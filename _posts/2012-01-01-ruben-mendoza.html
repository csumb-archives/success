<p>&quot;&#x2026;Dr. Mendoza gave
a short overview of the history of the Royal Chapel&#x2026;then we began
to break down the concrete at the foundation of the building&#x2026;We
used a hammer, chisel, and sledgehammer and were careful not to
break into the adobe that was beneath the surface&#x2026;Underneath the
dirt my colleague discovered two pieces of pottery (possibly from
the same artifact) and two pieces of glass and mudstone&#x2026;this was my
first time ever on an actual excavation site&#x2026;&quot;</p>
<p>-Excerpted from a student online journal entry</p>
<p>Dr. Ruben Mendoza delights in student journal entries like this.
When he came to CSUMB as a founding faculty member in 1995, he
helped develop CSUMB&apos;s highly hands-on, project- and outcomes-based
curriculum-a curriculum that allows students to have experiences at
working archaeological digs from the start. More than a decade
later, Ruben takes great pride in remaining committed to CSUMB&apos;s
unique curriculum.</p>
<p>Today Ruben oversees digs at the Royal Presidio in Monterey and
the missions in San Juan Bautista and Carmel, where students
quickly find themselves working in the dirt and discovering
historic objects. On one occasion, they came across a 19th century
copper cigarette holder, and on another a Spanish silver coin dated
to 1779, but more often students find the foundations of ancient
buildings and items such as pottery shards&#x2026;and every now and then
someone might locate counterfeit gold coins. &quot;I do play pranks and
plant things once in a while,&quot; laughs Ruben.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, the work being done at these sites does
have an important impact on our understanding of area history.
&quot;We&apos;ve had major findings that have turned existing research on its
head,&quot; says Ruben. One example was the discovery of poorly-fired
roof tiles at the Presidio site. These salmon-colored tiles
contradicted the existing belief that the roof of the building was
a deep red color. The recovery of the aforementioned Spanish &quot;half
real&quot; silver coin from foundation fill in turn served to date the
original perimeter defensive wall at the Presidio to 1779.</p>
<p>In addition to chisels and sledgehammers, archaeology students
use some of the most high-tech equipment available. Many classes
use wireless tablet PCs that allow them to upload their field
notes, journals, and specimen data on-site. You can read these
field journals on the <a href="http://archaeology.csumb.edu/wireless/journals.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Archaeology Institute website</a>.</p>
<p>Another group of fifteen students took these wireless tools,
database programs, barcode scanners, and related imaging
technologies to the museum at Mission
San Juan Bautista, where they cataloged the museum&apos;s collection and
redeveloped an archive of historical books and.documents dating
from 1500-1700. Thanks to their efforts, these materials are now
available for scholarly research.</p>
<p>Ruben has found that overseeing all these projects and working
extensively with students in the field has energized his writing;
he has seven forthcoming publications this academic year alone. It
makes for a good balance-Ruben demanding the best from his
students, and in turn, the students bringing out the best in
him.</p>
