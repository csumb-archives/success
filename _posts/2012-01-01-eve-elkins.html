<h5>Project nurtures salmon spawning along river</h5>
<p>After completing her Earth Systems Science &amp;
Policy B.S., Eve Elkins entered graduate school at UC Davis to
continue her research in watershed processes and restoration. As a
research associate there, her work included designing a project to
place over 6,000 tons of gravel in the Mokelumne River in San
Joaquin County.</p>
<p>The river used to be a good salmon habitat before extensive
gravel mining took place and Camanche Dam was built upstream in
1963. The dam keeps gravel from passing to a lower watershed where
salmon spawn. Without gravel, salmon egg-laying cannot occur.</p>
<p>Eve developed a computer-aided design and constructed two gravel
augmentation projects to restore salmon spawning on the river. This
has resulted in a large increase in the number of fish
spawning.</p>
<p>&quot;CSUMB provided me with the inspiration to explore and learn
more about those things that sparked my interest,&quot; says Eve. &quot;My
Capstone project provided invaluable experience in working
independently and helped to prepare me for a master&apos;s thesis.&quot;</p>
