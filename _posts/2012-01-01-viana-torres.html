<p>In a high school three miles north of the U.S.-Mexico
border, CSUMB alum Viana Torres is making a big difference.</p>
<p>Viana teaches history at Southwest High School, a comprehensive
four year school serving the low income communities of Nestor and
San Ysidro, just south of San Diego. As a history teacher, Viana is
constantly mindful of whose history she is teaching: &quot;I have a
responsibility to my students to teach in a way that is inclusive
and relevant to their life experiences.&quot;</p>
<p>She sites Ira Shor&apos;s book, Empowering Education: Critical
Teaching for Social Change as giving her a framework to examine the
lessons she is teaching-is it history from a male-oriented
Eurocentric perspective or a balanced, multicultural
perspective?</p>
<p>&quot;I am a firm believer that the curriculum must be relevant to
the student,&quot; she says. &quot;If not, they will be bored, become
uninterested in school, and potentially drop out. My goal is to
help break this cycle.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to fostering critical thinking and civic engagement
in her history classes, Viana has implemented the Safe Schools
Ambassador program, a student leadership program that trains high
school students to stop cruelty and violence on campus through
non-violent action.</p>
<p>&quot;This past school year, I had the wonderful opportunity to teach
a course specifically designed for the ambassadors. When it came
time to develop curriculum for the course, I went back to my old
CSUMB Service Learning binders for curriculum ideas,&quot; says Viana.
&quot;I am proud of the work that my students produce in class. In fact,
there will be two students from my Safe School Ambassador class who
will be attending CSUMB this fall because they were so interested
in continuing the learning that occurred while enrolled in the
course!&quot;</p>
<p>In 2007, Viana received the honor of being named
Southwest High&apos;s Teacher of the Year. She is quick to credit her
friends, family, and mentors for helping her achieve success. &quot;I
would not be teacher that I am today without the wonderful
mentorship that I received from key faculty, staff, and fellow
classmates. I also definitely owe a tremendous amount of gratitude
to my family for their support throughout my college years.&quot;</p>
<p>A Human Communication major, Viana was the first person in her
family to earn a college degree, and it wasn&apos;t easy at first. &quot;I
remember feeling so lost and confused during my first few days on
campus.&quot; However, as Viana connected with faculty and other
students, she found what brought her to CSUMB from her home in San
Jose in the first place: &quot;the supportive learning environment
promised in the Vision Statement.&quot;</p>
<p>Drawn in by the campus community, Viana became active in the
Service Learning Institute&apos;s Summer of Service Leadership Academy
and USA Program, M.E.Ch.A, Mujeres de Maiz, and California
Mini-Corps. Her involvement in these organizations and activities
reinforced her desire to find a career that would create positive
change.</p>
<p>&quot;After having witnessed the positive change that can be created
in the lives of students within the classroom, I quickly knew that
I wanted to become a high school teacher.&quot;</p>
<p>Now Viana lives her mission every day. &quot;As a teacher, my goals
are to teach history in a transformative manner that encourages the
students to become socially responsible community members. My goals
for the future are to live a long happy and healthy life in the
company of my family and friends!&quot;<br></p>
