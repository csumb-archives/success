<h5>Scholarships, passion, and fast food lead to growing math
program</h5>
<p>With professors
like Hongde Hu, it&apos;s no wonder CSUMB&apos;s math program is growing. His
passion for math seems contagious. &quot;He&apos;s like the Energizer&#x2122; bunny.
He&apos;s exciting,&quot; says Monica Galloway, a student taking her first
class with Hongde this summer.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&apos;s the food.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hongde is always taking us to get food. He loves taking his
classes to different Chinese buffets,&quot; relates math major Pam
Johnson. Once, when she and two fellow students were deeply
engrossed in solving a problem for the Mathematical Contest in
Modeling, Hongde told them he was going to get them some really
good Mexican food.</p>
<p>&quot;He came back with Taco Bell,&quot; Pam says with a laugh.</p>
<p>The combination of Hongde&apos;s infectious enthusiasm and MSG may be
the initial draw, but it is his commitment to students,
particularly minority students, that keeps them involved. &quot;You have
to show them you are committed to them,&quot; says Hongde. &quot;You have to
connect with the student-that&apos;s most important. Many of my students
are busy with work; they don&apos;t have time to contact me. So I have
to contact the student, make sure they are set.&quot;</p>
<p>One way Hongde makes sure his students are set is by helping
them secure scholarships that allow them to focus on their studies
and prepare for careers or graduate school. &quot;Some of the students
come from very poor families. My students sometimes work too many
hours so it&apos;s hard for them to come in and study well. That&apos;s why
we try to get them scholarships &#x2013; so they don&apos;t need to work 50-60
hours a week,&quot; Hongde explains.</p>
<p>A major source of scholarships for Hongde&apos;s students is the
Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program, a project
led on CSUMB&apos;s campus by Dr. William Head, a professor in the
Division of Science and Environmental Policy. Funded by the
National Science Foundation, LSAMP&apos;s goal is to increase the number
of students from underrepresented minority groups earning degrees
in science and math, and encourage students to pursue graduate
degrees in those fields.</p>
<p>This summer, with LSAMP funding, Hongde is working closely with
about a dozen students to help them produce top level undergraduate
work-and position them to get into the best graduate programs.</p>
<p>Pam Johnson, a Native American scholarship recipient, will spend
the summer working on research for her Senior Capstone, the final
project which represents the culmination of her education at CSUMB.
She will also prepare to again participate in the Mathematical
Contest in Modeling. Last year, she and her Taco Bell-fueled team
took home the second-highest honor in a field of 970 colleges from
around the world, all competing by using mathematical models to
solve real world problems.</p>
<p>Brenda Thomas and Monica Galloway, both African-American reentry
students, will attend summer workshops to prepare for the GRE. They
also hope to attend some conferences and get a preview of what
different graduate schools offer. &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll stop until I
get my doctorate. I&apos;m going to be like Hongde. I want to eventually
teach math at a university or junior college,&quot; says Brenda.</p>
<p>Thanks to LSAMP-supported summer workshops and a research
internship with Hongde, David Stansell may graduate a year early-if
he doesn&apos;t decide to spend next year studying abroad in Japan.</p>
<p>Other students will attend workshops that prepare them to serve
as math tutors in three predominantly Hispanic local high schools.
This has the double benefit of reinforcing the skills of the tutors
and exposing high school students to mentors who have successfully
continued their studies in college.</p>
<p>All have almost daily contact with Hongde.</p>
<p>For Hongde, teaching wasn&apos;t always this way. Prior to joining
CSUMB in 1999, he taught at the University of Pennsylvania. &quot;It&apos;s a
totally different kind of environment. There, I couldn&apos;t remember
any students&apos; names-with 200 students I just showed up. I had 10
TAs. I was only there for three hours, just taught one class,
that&apos;s all. Professors are busy with their own business, research,
traveling,&quot; Hongde explains.</p>
<p>Hongde arrived on the West Coast with a job offer at Stanford.
But then he learned about a job at CSUMB: &quot;They didn&apos;t have a math
minor or major. They only offered calculus and discrete math. I
thought it was really, really interesting that the university was
new. When I interviewed I found the colleagues here just amazing,
so I decided to come.&quot;</p>
<p>Together with department chair Don Pierce, Hongde expanded the
math program. In 2002, the math minor was approved. New faculty
members were hired. More and more students chose the math minor.
Then, in 2004, the major was approved. In two years, the major grew
to 50 students, a number Hongde hopes will double.</p>
<p>&quot;I established a math club in 2004-we had a bowling party and
another party in the BBC so students can get some rest, do some
math, do some talking, do some work,&quot; says Hongde. &quot;The whole point
is to get more students interested in math.&quot;</p>
<p>Hongde&apos;s winning recipe of personal attention, scholarships,
bowling, expertise and enthusiasm for the subject, and fast food
has hooked a growing number of students. If he continues dishing it
out, he&apos;ll have success in the bag.</p>
