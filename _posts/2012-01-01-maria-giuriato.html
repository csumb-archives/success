<h5>Former HCOM student committed to public service</h5>
<p>Maria Giuriato juggles a busy life.</p>
<p>Salinas city councilmember, Health Professions Education
Foundation executive director, wife, and mother of two. This
accurately describes Maria Giuriato, former Human Communication
student.</p>
<p>Giuriato serves as the District 5 councilmember for the City of
Salinas and was recently appointed by the governor to serve as the
executive director of the Health Professions Education Foundation.
She has also worked for the county as community relations manager
for the Department of Social Services for the past six years.</p>
<p>&quot;My long term goals are to continue in the political arena and
to work in an environment that helps me support members of our
society who are struggling against insurmountable odds to escape
poverty,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Giuriato is responsible for community and government relations
pertaining to legislation, policy and resources. In addition to
representing her department to all levels of government, she is
directly involved with the community regarding affordable housing,
healthcare, education, mentoring, legislation, policy and community
engagement. Specific services offered include emergency response to
child abuse, elder care and referrals for foster care, emergency
benefits, and Medi-Cal.</p>
<p>&quot;Education and knowledge are the keys to addressing injustice in
our community,&quot; said Giuriato. &quot;This is why I continue to be
involved in the education arena and serve as a mentor to several
youth every year.</p>
<p>&quot;CSUMB inspired me to continue my life-long goal of providing
knowledge and opportunities to people who aren&apos;t always in the
loop. It also gave me insight into how and why others communicate
the way they do. My ethics training has also allowed me the insight
to relate to others at a whole different level of reflection and
understanding.&quot;</p>
<p>Giuriato would like to return to CSUMB in the future for a
master&apos;s degree. She just needs to find a way to balance the time
commitment to further her education-in addition to being a
dedicated mom, executive director, and city councilmember.</p>
