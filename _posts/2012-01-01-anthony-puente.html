<h5>Alum&apos;s film wins award</h5>
<p>After completing his Teledramatic Arts and Technology B.A.,
Anthony Puente moved on to graduate study in the Directors Program
at UCLA&apos;s School of Film &amp; Television. While there, he won the
2004 Directors Guild of America (DGA) Student Film Award in the
Latino category for his short film, titled <em>Diego</em>. The
purpose of the DGA awards is to honor and bring attention to the
work of outstanding minority and women film students. Anthony also
screened <em>Diego</em> in France at the Cannes Film Festival,
along with other top student films.</p>
<p>Recognizing the value of the award, Anthony says, &quot; It was great
to have my family see that their investment is actually paying off.
It has also had a huge impact on the film being screened around the
world.&quot;</p>
<p>Stressing the seriousness of the film&apos;s theme, Anthony notes
that &quot;<em>Diego</em> is the story of a street-level drug dealer who
finds himself at a crossroads where he has to decide between his
young son and selling drugs. In this film, I tried to portray the
realities of life on the street and the complexities in the
decisions we make to survive.&quot;</p>
<p>Puente is now in the preproduction stage for his thesis film,
<em>How Deep is the Ocean</em>, a dramatic comedy &quot;about a slacker
in the midst of a quarter-life crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>His first film, <em>Fallen Between the Cracks</em>, debuted at
the Mill Valley Film Festival and the United Nations Film Fest.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope to be happy and working on projects that I believe in
and that fulfill me creatively-and a huge deal at a studio wouldn&apos;t
be bad either.&quot;</p>
<p>Anthony enjoyed his years at CSUMB, because &quot;there weren&apos;t many
restrictions and limitations when I was a student. During those
days there were no rules and, if there were, we helped develop them
by pushing the envelope. The sense of <em>anything&apos;s possible</em>
has helped me tremendously as an independently-minded
filmmaker.&quot;</p>
