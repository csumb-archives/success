<h5>CSUMB librarian helps take the byte out of homework</h5>
<p><br>
CSUMB reference
librarian Enid Irwin, with help from several students, is making it
safer and easier for youngsters to go online for homework help.</p>
<p>Irwin is the project manager for KidsClick, a kid-friendly
search engine based at San Jose State University&apos;s School of
Library and Information Science, where Irwin teaches online classes
in addition to her work at CSUMB.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kidsclick.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kidsclick.org</a> is an easy-to-navigate collection of
more than7,000 sites that have been carefully previewed by
librarians and found appropriate for youngsters - there&apos;s no fear
of a child inadvertently stumbling onto an adult Web site.</p>
<p>Enter a word or phrase and KidsClick may display only a handful
of related Web sites - not the thousands of links you&apos;d get from
Google or Yahoo. The sites have been screened for their educational
value.</p>
<p>The site is free and non-commercial - meaning there are no ads.
And its content is designed to support the school curriculum.</p>
<p>The site gets 60,000 hits per day and is one of the top websites
for children&apos;s material, said Irwin. After an overhaul of the site
- currently under way - Irwin hopes that number will dramatically
increase.</p>
<p>The overhaul includes a redesign to make it more appealing to
kids in the 9-to-14 age group, a content review and a formal set of
standards to determine what&apos;s appropriate material for that age
group, and &quot;back-end&quot; work, redesigning the way the site
functions.</p>
<p>Graduate students at San Jose State are reviewing the content,
while CSUMB students are trying to make it more appealing to kids -
working on the graphic elements, logos and overall look of the site
as well as creating sound and video files for it.</p>
<p>In the future, she hopes to have CSUMB students film story hours
and other activities at local public libraries and post the video
on the site.</p>
<p>&quot;All of these things will make the web page more appealing to
kids, but still have content that supports the curriculum,&quot; she
said.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to make the site engaging - fun and informative. And I
wanted to work with CSUMB students because I know they&apos;ll have the
guidance and support of their instructors. I&apos;ve worked with Valerie
Landau and Bobbi Long and they&apos;re eager for their students to have
an opportunity to do real-world stuff,&quot; Irwin said.</p>
<p>Irwin has an MBA, then about 10 years ago, she returned to
school to earn a master&apos;s in library science at San Jose State.
That led to positions with Silicon Valley firms Hewlett Packard and
Synopsys, and teaching computer classes at community colleges.</p>
<p>A desire to relocate to Monterey brought her to CSUMB, where she
completed the Master&apos;s of Instructional Science and Technology
program. The skills she acquired along the way are all useful in
her position as project manager for KidsClick.</p>
<p>&quot;I like working with students from San Jose State and CSUMB,
bringing them together. It&apos;s a nice synergy. It gives the CSUMB
students a chance to work on a real-world project and shows them -
by working with the grad students at San Jose State - what graduate
school is like,&quot; said Irwin.</p>
