<p> Judy Cortes,
field placement coordinator in the Department of Teacher Education
and Spanish-language instructor in the School of World Languages
and Cultures, has been awarded a Fulbright Scholar grant to lecture
in Chile.</p>
<p>The four-month grant will begin in March 2007 and will allow Dr.
Cortes to lecture at the Catholic University of Temuco, a city of
more than 300,000 in the southern part of the country. Her topic
will be improving curriculum design.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the things that appeals to me about this assignment is
the fact that Temuco is a diverse area,&quot; Dr. Cortes said. &quot;There&apos;s
a large indigenous population,&quot; referring to the fact that Temuco
is the cultural center of the Mapuche Indians, who make up 25
percent of the area&apos;s residents.</p>
<p>Dr. Cortes is one
of 850 U.S. faculty members and professionals who will travel
abroad to 150 countries during the 2006-07 academic year through
the Fulbright Scholar Program. Established in 1946 under
legislation introduced by the late Senator J. William Fulbright of
Arkansas, the program&apos;s purpose is to build mutual understanding
between the people of the United States and other countries.</p>
<p>The program is sponsored by the U,S. Department of State&apos;s
Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Recipients are selected
on the basis of academic or professional achievement and because
they have demonstrated leadership in their fields.</p>
<p>Dr. Cortes, a native of Uruguay, joined the university in 1995,
handling field placements in the School of Education and teaching
Spanish. She holds a bachelor&apos;s and a master&apos;s degree in Spanish
from UCLA, a master&apos;s in Educational Administration from San Jose
State University, and a Ph.D. in Hispanic languages and
literatures, also from UCLA.</p>
<p>While her primary role at CSUMB has been in teacher education,
she teaches Spanish classes for the School of World Languages and
Cultures.</p>
<p>&quot;My love is teaching,&quot; she said. &quot;How can I supervise teachers
unless I teach?&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Cortes has a broad background in education. Before coming to
CSUMB, she worked for the Salinas City School District, in
bi-lingual education. She&apos;s also been on the faculty at the
University of Hawaii and Monterey Peninsula College and was part of
a team that wrote a Spanish-language textbook used at Monterey&apos;s
Defense Language Institute for 20 years.</p>
<p>She is the second CSUMB faculty member to win a Fulbright this
academic year. Dr. Lorenzo Covarrubias, an instructor in the
Division of Social, Behavioral and Global Studies, left in August
to spend the year lecturing at the Autonomous University of
Sinaloa-Mazatlan, in Mazatlan, Mexico.</p>
