<h5>Tech-savvy artist helps students find new modes of
expression</h5>
<p>In the late &apos;80s,
Pat Watson became convinced that the Macintosh computer was the
right tool for a project that merged photographs and text. He paid
$2,300 for the best computer available-a MacPlus with a screen the
size of a postcard. On that day he stepped into the world of
digital art -and hasn&apos;t looked back.</p>
<p>Watson came to CSUMB in 1999 after teaching at Sierra Nevada
College near Lake Tahoe. It was a fortuitous moment: Watson wanted
to move to the Monterey Bay area and CSUMB had an opening for
someone with his unique expertise in digital art and design.</p>
<p>Watson keeps close track of the new boundaries being forged in
this emerging genre. &quot;There is some very adventurous stuff going
on&#x2026;[This generation] has grown up in a screen-based world-weaned on
the screen by commercials, TV titles, and music videos. You can see
that as a negative if you want, but I see it as an opportunity for
people to be creative in a different realm. A lot of very
intriguing work is being done with, for example, image sampling in
the same way hip hop is sound sampling. A lot of the work is very
personal, expressive, challenging, and abstract.&quot;</p>
<p>Among the students, Watson is famous for his digital art and
design course that entails studying the abstract visual qualities
of letter forms and a project titled &quot;Postmodern Me&quot; in which
students &quot;apply philosophy and theory to a representation of how
they feel and think about who they are at this point in time in the
cosmos.&quot; Pretty heavy stuff.</p>
<p>In addition to digital art and design, Watson teaches a course
in 3D animation which resulted in what he considers to be his
greatest accomplishment at CSUMB-the Tanimura &amp; Antle Family
Memorial Library flythrough. Watson led a team of three students in
the creation of a three-dimensional visualization of the future
library. It was an immensely challenging project for both Watson
and the students. &quot;It did turn out to be a colossal undertaking. It
really helps people understand the kind of work that they do at
DreamWorks and Pixar and ILM.&quot;</p>
<p>With the flythrough completed, Watson is spending the summer
writing a book on digital art. Always one to embrace technology,
Watson utilizes an iPod to finetune his writing. He records himself
reading his latest chapter, then plays it back, listening for areas
that need improvement. &quot;A lot of the ideas in the book have been
percolating around in my mind for quite a while. Now I&apos;m just
trying to massage those into a more coherent form.&quot; When the book
is complete, he plans to podcast each chapter and then use the
podcasts in his courses.</p>
<p>There is more to Watson, though, than technology junkie. An avid
surfer since 1965, Watson still manages to hit the waves on an
almost daily basis. Growing up in Venice and Long Beach instilled a
deep love of the ocean in him. &quot;I love the beach as much now as I
ever did. It&apos;s still such a treat to go out and watch the waves and
be in the sand and just be a part of the whole experience.&quot;</p>
<p>Before the MacPlus, Watson was involved in more traditional art
forms: photography and painting. His work has been displayed in
galleries and the Nevada Museum of Fine Art. He also previously
taught photography, drawing, and painting. When not teaching, he
worked as a designer, both freelance and with an ad agency.</p>
<p>Ultimately, for Watson, his teaching and his career come down to
a celebration of creativity and expression. &quot;I&apos;ve tried to really
incorporate as much about art and creativity and design as I
could.&quot;</p>
