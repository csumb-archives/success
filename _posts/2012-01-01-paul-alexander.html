<p>SBS Professor Paul Alexander can relate to the
problems students come to him with during office hours-just two
years ago, he was a student himself.</p>
<p>Paul graduated from CSUMB in 2005 with a degree in Social and
Behavioral Sciences. He went straight into an accelerated master&apos;s
degree program in anthropology at the University of Chicago,
earning his master&apos;s degree in a single year. After that, Paul
returned to CSUMB, this time as a faculty member.</p>
<p>&quot;My favorite part of the job is working one on one with students
and being able to mentor them,&quot; says Paul. &quot;I can relate to what
the students are going through because I went through it not that
long ago myself. I know that it can be frustrating and stressful,
but it should be stressful-graduating from college should not be a
walk through the park. But it&apos;s helpful that I can relate to that
and know what it&apos;s like. Just a year ago I was stressing through my
master&apos;s thesis and finishing classes for grad school, so I am very
close to that feeling.&quot;</p>
<p>Paul knows how important faculty mentors are; if it weren&apos;t for
the mentors he found as a student in the SBS department, he may
never have discovered his passion for intellectual study.</p>
<p>Paul wasn&apos;t the greatest student in high school, and after a
two-year stint in a junior college he figured he was finished with
his education. &quot;I was out of school for three years, working full
time at for a corporate giant when I hit the ceiling at my job. At
that point I knew that if I wanted to do something that was
appealing to me, I&apos;d need a degree,&quot; says Paul.</p>
<p>Paul chose CSUMB because it was close enough to his family in
Morgan Hill, but far enough away to feel like a change. He also
liked the small class sizes, on-campus housing, and overall
affordability. But the most important factor Paul discovered was
the freedom to direct his own academic experience.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t excel in high school because I wasn&apos;t given
the freedom to do what I wanted; I felt limited by the structure. I
didn&apos;t work in well in environments where I was told what to do. I
did my job and could function, but I had no passion for it,&quot; he
says.</p>
<p>&quot;When I started getting close to my faculty members and mentors
I could see that there was a freedom in working with your mind and
being an intellectual, using your mind as your main tool of
operation. One of my professors once said &apos;I own my means of
production; there is no one who can tell me what to do with my
mind.&apos; The idea of focusing the whole of my attention onto the kind
of problems I&apos;m interested in-that concept was very appealing to
me.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Manuel Carlos helped him explore this idea further.
Paul explains, &quot;I was a teaching assistant for Professor Carlos and
he really mentored me on what it meant to be a part of academia,
what it meant to be an intellectual, and helped me clarify what it
was I wanted to do.&quot;</p>
<p>And so his career trajectory was set. In graduate school he
developed a research agenda centered on immigration and completed
his thesis on the impact of the Mexican Consulate on the lives of
Mexican citizens living in Chicago.<br>
<br>
Now, in addition to teaching, Paul continues his research on the
Mexican immigrant experience: &quot;I study a lot in Watsonville, right
up the coast. The anthropology faculty has been working in
Watsonville for almost seven years, studying the community, looking
at how people use public space, especially in the downtown area,
and looking at the lives of Mexican immigrants who live in the
city.&quot;</p>
<p>Paul is working on two archive projects to showcase the research
he and other SBS faculty members and students have done. One
includes audio, video, photographs, and writing about the
Watsonville community. The second project includes a photography
exhibit that celebrates CSUMB&apos;s relationship with Universidad
Autonoma de Queretaro in Mexico. Student and faculty exchanges
between the two universities began shortly after CSUMB was founded
and this archive and exhibit provide a historical perspective on
the research that&apos;s been done between the two institutions.</p>
<p>Between the research, archive projects, and teaching, Paul puts
his mental means of production to good use. He recalls in impact of
his professors, now his colleagues, and reflects, &quot;Finding your
vocation in life is not an easy thing by any stretch of the
imagination. It&apos;s the mentors we find on our way who can point out
what we are good at and point out what we might be able to do. They
did that for me here as a student, and as a grad student, and now
coming back here they&apos;ve been there every step of the
way.&quot;<br></p>
