<p>&quot;Be well, do good
work, and keep in touch.&quot; Every morning when NPR&apos;s Garrison Keeler
sign-offs off with this signature line, Seth Pollack is reminded of
his mission. Seth, an associate professor and director of the
Service Learning Institute, spent ten years in the field &quot;doing
good work,&quot; and now is helping students realize the impact that
service can have in communities, and in themselves.</p>
<p>But don&apos;t let the simplicity of the phrase fool you. CSUMB&apos;s
take on service learning has elevated simple &quot;community service&quot;
from mere good work into something far more complex. &quot;In a helping
situation the typical concept is that power isn&apos;t equal. The person
who helps has a lot of power and the person who is being helped
doesn&apos;t have a lot of power. We try to help students understand
that and think about who they are in that context. The goal of
service learning is to think more deeply about the dynamic of
trying to help,&quot; explains Seth.</p>
<p>Unlike most programs that just send students out to get work
done, service learning at CSUMB brings students back into the
classroom to discuss the issues of identity, diversity, and social
justice that arise when working in various communities.</p>
<p>These are issues that Seth knows well. &quot;When I teach and work
with students I am always drawing on my experience as a peace corps
volunteer. For five years I worked in communities as a stranger.&quot;
Seth was in the Peace Corps in Mali, a desert country in West
Africa, where he worked primarily with women&apos;s groups on issues of
conservation and economic empowerment. His status as a man and
status as a Westerner with outside knowledge were important factors
in his interactions.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an expression in Mali: &apos;No matter how long a log stays
in the water, it will never become an alligator.&apos; You have this
sense that no matter how much you try as an outsider to become
someone who belongs, you&apos;re not. You are always going to be an
outsider. However, there is a corollary to that proverb: &apos;Some logs
can really scare the hell outta ya.&apos; So there is this dynamic-I am
here to help&#x2026;I&apos;m an outsider and I want to belong&#x2026; maybe I can
belong, but maybe I can never belong&#x2026;&apos; What do you do with
that?&quot;</p>
<p>Through service learning courses, Seth and other faculty members
work through these opposing concepts with students. &quot;The semester
is really helping the students come to terms with that irony of
service and not freeze themselves in any one position. To really be
thoughtful about this work. Because the truth is, if we just stay
home, nothing will ever change.&quot;</p>
<p>Here is where the keeping in touch part comes in. As students do
the work and think critically about the implications of service,
they are also forging important relationships-developing their
skills as &quot;multicultural community builders,&quot; a phrase coined by
the leaders of the Service Learning Institute. &quot;That&apos;s how change
is going to happen. It&apos;s those networks that are really
powerful.&quot;<br>
Twenty years after leaving Mali, Seth remains in contact with the
women there. &quot;For me, the hope for the future in the globalized
world is not that everyone becomes more like us [Americans], but
that we learn from each other. That to me is a powerful definition
of globalization-that we can be in each other&apos;s lives and recognize
the potential for domination and be sensitive to that.&quot;</p>
<p>Knowing that one doesn&apos;t have to join the Peace Corps and travel
halfway around the globe to have a transformative cross-cultural
experience, Seth and the Service Learning Institute help students
navigate these encounters in local communities like Seaside and
Salinas.</p>
<p>Despite consistently positive post-service survey data, not
everyone on campus has readily embraced the service learning
requirement. Some students resist initially, saying required
volunteerism is an oxymoron. Others aren&apos;t sure their politics will
jive with what is being taught in class. In acknowledging these
challenges, Seth counters &quot;Everyone, no matter what your politics,
should have a deep understanding of your social responsibility.
It&apos;s not to say we will all have the same definition and same
strategies and same solutions to problems, but we should all have
deep understandings of what our social responsibility is. That is
the potential of this program.&quot;</p>

<p>These challenges aren&apos;t surprising. Service learning is a new
field and CSUMB is on the forefront in combining community service
with academic exploration of identity, diversity, and social
justice. &quot;No other program in that nation, in higher education, has
as sophisticated and as deep an understanding of this work as we&apos;ve
developed here.&quot; But, just like an outsider who will never
completely belong, the Service Learning Institute hasn&apos;t absolutely
mastered the delivery of these lessons. &quot;It&apos;s challenging doing
teaching around issues of diversity and power in a required course.
We are still figuring out how to do it really, really well. We are
getting better at it every semester, but I still feel like we are
just learning,&quot; says Seth.</p>
<p>Developing the openness and patience to continue listening,
thinking, and learning about these complex topics is the basis of
service learning at CSUMB. It&apos;s a continuum, with no concrete end,
no easy answers, and no final pinnacle of success. But along the
way it is possible to make friends and do good work. For Seth, that
is the ultimate gift. &quot;For me, having spent a decade of my life
thinking hard about making a difference, and seeing that there is a
university that is committed to having students grapple with that,
and making that a core part of what the academic program is about,
I thought wow, this is for me. There is no other job in higher
education that I&apos;d rather have.&quot;</p>
