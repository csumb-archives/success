<p>After a few minutes talking to Marisol Duarte-Clark,
you start to wonder, when does she sleep?</p>
<p>In addition taking 18 units, Marisol, a multiple subject
credential student, splits her time between student teaching second
graders at Jesse Sanchez Elementary School in Salinas and working
in an after-school program at Alianza Charter School in
Watsonville. Oh, and on top of that, she&apos;s producing a play.</p>
<p>Born and raised in San Jose, Marisol attended a junior college
in Cupertino and then transferred to UC Santa Cruz to complete her
undergraduate degree in theatre arts with an emphasis in modern
dance. After two years working as a substitute teacher, she decided
to earn her teaching credential. She was drawn to CSUMB because of
the Vision Statement and the mission of the School of
Education.</p>
<p>&quot;The education department is really geared toward teaching
populations that are in need&#x2014;students who have been
disenfranchised, who are low income, or live in urban settings. We
learn how to really teach and work with these populations of
students given structures like No Child Left Behind,&quot; says
Marisol.</p>
<p>For the last two years, Marisol has put those skills to work by
teaching drama and dance in after school programs in Watsonville
geared toward the children of migrant farmworkers. &quot;Alianza is one
of the only bilingual dual immersion programs&#x2014;half the curriculum
is in Spanish and half is in English.&quot;</p>
<p>As a student teacher, Marisol works with a similar student
population in Salinas. &quot;Jesse E. Sanchez is also a predominantly
migrant school, and they have even less resources than the school
in Watsonville.&quot;</p>
<p>Carolina Serna, one of Marisol&apos;s professors, commented, &quot;When
collaborating with classmates [Marisol] made insightful
contributions, often sharing experiences from her own teaching and
other community involvement.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I specifically go to these places,&quot; Marisol says, &quot;because that
is my whole mission&#x2014;to learn how to work with children who are at
risk, children who come from unprivileged backgrounds, who have
been disenfranchised.&quot;</p>
<p>Marisol can relate to many of the challenges facing her
students. &quot;I didn&apos;t grow up as a migrant worker, but I did grow up
in the barrio and I did grow up on free lunch with a single mom who
raised three kids. I&apos;m hoping to be some sort of inspiration to my
family as well as the community. It&apos;s where my motivation comes
from&#x2026;it hasn&apos;t&apos; been easy for me at all, but I think that because
of that, I know exactly what these students need&#x2014;not that I was
migrant, but I can completely understand what it is like to live
off free lunch and struggle.&quot;</p>
<p>Marisol&apos;s background in theater is an important element of this
mission: &quot;You really can do miracles with dance and theater without
any money, I mean, it&apos;d be nice to have sets and costumes, but
theater is one of those things that can empower children to deal
with their issues <a href="http://success.staging.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/59/igx_migrate/files/Panza%20Monlogues%20Flier.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"></a>and allow for creative expression without costing
a lot of money. And that is something you got to keep in mind when
you are working with children who don&apos;t always have food for dinner
or a place to live.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to empowering children, Marisol is using theater and
dance to build community on campus. She&apos;s in the student club
Ollin, the bailefolklorico dance group on campus, and incorporating
this style of dance into a play she&apos;s producing called <em>The
Panza Monologues.</em> The play primarily deals with female body
image&#x2014;panza refers to the belly, womb, and the rolls of fat so
often found there.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m organizing this because I wanted to see Chicana theater
happen on this campus, and create a space for female
multiculturalism.</p>
<p>&quot;There are plenty of other Chicana plays, but my favorite,
<em>Real Women Have Curves</em>, only has six characters. I wanted
to have one that could incorporate as many women as possible, like
the <em>Vagina Monologues</em>, so that it can be a unifying
event.</p>
<p>&quot;I was trying to create this network of women of color. It&apos;s a
very bonding, community building experience.&quot;</p>
<p>Marisol secured funding for the play from the Interclub Council,
but she is still struggling to pull together all the necessary
resources for the production. &quot;You have to work with dancers,
actors, set designers, lighting people, the PR person, the
director, and publicity&#x2026;it&apos;s endless.</p>
<p>&quot;Although I might get grey hairs and I&apos;ve been met with tons of
challenges and obstacles, I am so determined. I&apos;ve wanted to throw
my hat in a few times, but I can&apos;t. There&apos;s no way I&apos;m going to
back out.&quot;</p>
<p>Shannon Edwards, a Teledramatic Arts and Technology professor,
has gotten her class involved in the play. She explains what its
like to working with Marisol: &quot;As the Producer of <em>Panza
Monologues</em>, Marisol can make anything happen! As a graduate of
UCSC where community based theatre is thriving, she used her
ingenuity and &quot;can do&quot; attitude to create new collaborations at
CSUMB. She has a true gift for discovering the community treasures
here at CSUMB (ie. amazingly talented students from all parts of
the campus). Her energy is boundless and contagious. I hope all of
the campus gets to see this important play this weekend at the
BBC.&quot;</p>
<p><em>The Panza Monologues</em> runs in the BBC on April 27 and
28, 2007 at 7:30 p.m. Marisol plans to spend her summer teaching
and studying for the RICA, and after that she only has one more
class. &quot;People might think I&apos;m crazy. Normally people would never
do this, but I am grateful the school is letting me pursue what it
is that I need right now, which is to incorporate the arts into my
pedagogy.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m following my own path and doing what it is I need to do to
become a better teacher. I&apos;ve gained some amazing tools on how to
teach in this program.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps after that, Marisol will finally be able to get some
sleep.</p>
