<h5>A passion for filmmaking</h5>
<p>Through a solid education and a determination to
succeed, David Kashevaroff has shaped his career the way he
intended. With relentless drive and a passion for film editing, he
has succeeded in a career known for its long hours and intense
competition.</p>
<p>Radio had been a longtime interest, but, after taking a radio
broadcasting class at CSUMB, David decided to switch his major to
Teledramatic Arts and Technology.</p>
<p>&quot;The radio class led me to the TAT building and everything that
went on there,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;I quickly became interested in media creation. I found my
interests peaked in the editing classes offered. It opened up the
world of digital editing. I took other classes and made films, but
editing was where my passion was. I wanted to be involved in art
for a living, and this was my calling.&quot;</p>
<p>Editing is the process of condensing a film until the filmmaker
is left with only the elements needed to tell the story. When a
film is shot, there are many more hours of footage than the
audience sees. The editor sifts through the footage and constructs
a story by analyzing the performances, mood, and camera technique.
Editing requires both creativity and skill.</p>
<p>The editing process is said to be the final stage of rewriting.
The writer&apos;s script guides the director, actors, producer,
cinematographer, costume designer, production designer, and others,
but the editor is one of the last stops. There are thousands of
directions a story can go once it&apos;s shot. A talented editor ensures
that only the best story finds its way to the audience.</p>
<p>&quot;My experiences in TAT were unique. The classes were small,
there was lots of new equipment to use, and plenty of opportunity
to be creative. I wanted to be a jack-of-all-trades. An
understanding of all aspects of production helps your
interpretation of whatever aspect you specialize in. That&apos;s what I
believe put me ahead of the pack. I had hands-on experience with a
lot of tools that are still standard in the film industry
today.&quot;</p>
<p>After graduation, David began working for NBC in graphic arts
and animation. Within a year, he was accepted into the master&apos;s
program for film editing at the American Film Institute (AFI) in
Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&quot;When I began my schooling at AFI, there were only two out of 14
editors who knew the AVID editing system inside and out. I was
amazed at how many people entering a master&apos;s program for editing
knew so little about the technology. I owe my knowledge of it to
TAT. There are many more applicable lessons learned at TAT that
apply to everyday work in the film industry, such as organization,
understanding work flow, and problem-solving.&quot;</p>
<p>David&apos;s primary interest lies in feature films and
documentaries. He also finds them the most difficult to work
on.</p>
<p>&quot;While I was finishing up my M.F.A. in editing, I was working as
an assistant editor on a feature documentary being cut over at
Paramount Pictures. Following graduation, I was able to devote more
time to that film. I was brought in to help edit the film in the
final months of postproduction.&quot; David worked on the project with
an Academy Award-winning editor, which helped broaden his
creativity and knowledge of editing.</p>
<p><em>The Monster and the Peanut</em> was one of two AFI thesis
films David edited. It won an Emmy Award for best short drama and
has played at such festivals as Cannes International, Cleveland,
Philadelphia and Nashville. Another short film, titled
<em>Raveling</em>, also played at Cannes last year. <em>One Man&apos;s
War</em> was a short film about the Tulsa race riots of the early
1900s. It has played at the Harlem Film Festival, the San Francisco
Black Film Festival and has been licensed by Showtime and PBS. Most
recently, David was part of a team that won an Oscar for the
documentary, <em>A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of Norman
Corwin</em>.</p>
<p>David says that breaking into the film industry is &quot;difficult
and takes a lot of patience, long hours, low pay, and good luck.
It&apos;s highly competitive in every aspect and takes a lot of resolve
and commitment.&quot;</p>
<p>His advice for fellow alums: &quot;You have to be able to see past
what you may be doing at the moment, and look forward to where you
want to end up.&quot; As for editing, &quot;a sense of humor is necessary,
and don&apos;t take anything personally. It&apos;s a rough business filled
with egos. As an editor, don&apos;t let yours get in the way.&quot;</p>
