<p>Success Stories ~ Nicholas Huerta</p>
<p>Nicholas Huerta, a
Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Scholar, has
joined Moss Landing Marine Lab&apos;s Submersible Capable of under Ice
Navigation and Imaging (SCINI) team. The project, the first of its
kind, is using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) that fits through
a small hole in the Antarctic ice. The new ROV allows the team to
reach locations under the ice that have been too remote or too deep
to access previously. The vehicle has navigational, visual, and
sonar imagery capabilities that will allow the SCINI team to create
maps of these areas. Nicholas is assisting in building the ROV, and
in research to better understand the marine science of the polar
region. He&apos;ll travel to Antarctica this fall and winter, and will
be based at the McMurdo Station.</p>
