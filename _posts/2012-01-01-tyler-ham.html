<h5>Another former Teledramatic Arts and Technology student was
part of an Oscar-winning film.</h5>
<p>Tyler Ham, who attended CSUMB in the late 1990s, was part of a
team that won an Oscar for achievement in visual effects at the
2007Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Ham works as a digital artist for Industrial Light and Magic, a
special effects company based in San Francisco. The ILM team won
the Oscar for its work on &apos;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&apos;s
Chest.&apos;</p>
<p>George Lucas founded ILM in May 1975. The company has produced
special effects for a variety of films, including the Indiana Jones
series, the Harry Potter films, the Jurassic Park films, many of
the Star Trek films, as well as less dramatic effects in films such
as Schindler&apos;s List, Snow Falling on Cedars, Magnolia, and several
Woody Allen films. It&apos;s widely considered to be the best visual
effects studio in the world.</p>
<p>After leaving CSUMB in 1999, Ham transferred to Expression
College for Digital Arts in Emeryville, where he earned a
bachelor&apos;s degree.</p>
<p>Since then, he&apos;s worked on more than a dozen feature films.
&apos;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&apos;s End&apos; - which will be released
this summer - also features his work. And last year he worked as a
layout artist for an episode of TV&apos;s Colbert Report.</p>
<p>Via e-mail, Ham said that his greatest professional
accomplishment was getting hired at ILM.</p>
<p>&quot;I got the job in October 2005 to work on &apos;Pirates of the
Caribbean: Dead Man&apos;s Chest.&apos; However, I first started applying to
ILM way back in the summer of 1997 for internships. After several
applications and interviews for different positions over the years
- which weren&apos;t successful - finally hearing them say, &apos;We are
prepared to make you an offer&apos; was just a dream come true.&quot;</p>
<p>He&apos;s generous in his praise of CSUMB and what it&apos;s done for
him.</p>
<p>&quot;My TAT education has helped me almost on a daily basis.
Although I don&apos;t work in on-set production, the visual effects
workflow has many of the same elements.</p>
<p>&quot;I work daily with fully computer-generated cameras and they are
set up very much like a true film camera, and the terminology as
well as proper camera blocking and movement are vital to my job
success.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m also putting together a short film on the side, which fits
my TAT training perfectly. From scriptwriting to editing, all the
TAT elements are involved.</p>
<p>&quot;If I could give one bit of advice to TAT students, it would be
to pay attention in all the classes, even ones you don&apos;t think you
want to follow as a career. I regret not taking full advantage of a
few classes that I have interest in now as a professional that I
didn&apos;t care about as a student.&quot;</p>
<p>Do you have anything to share with other students?</p>
<p>&quot;I know this is a clich&#xE9;, but keeping working toward your dream.
I&apos;m with the company I wanted to work for since high school. It
took nine yeas, but I did it, and that made the &apos;victory&apos; all the
sweeter.&quot;</p>
<p>Tyler is the second former TAT student to win an Oscar. In 2006,
