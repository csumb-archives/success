<h5>Switching majors launches a high-tech career</h5>
<p>When he first arrived at CSUMB, Joel Kaufman set his
sights on studying marine engineering-but an unexpected change
would send him on a totally different career path.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was considering where to go, I found an interesting
limitation in transferring from a junior college to a four-year
school,&quot; Joel recalls. &quot;At the time, the UC would not allow
students to transfer as a junior without their foreign language
requirement complete, but the CSU would. Once I knew that, I
started looking at various CSUs, and<br>
what struck me about CSUMB was a listing<br>
for a marine engineering program.&quot;</p>
<p>When he arrived at CSUMB, he discovered that the marine
engineering program was not going to be offered after all. Deciding
to stay at the new university anyway, he switched his major to
Telecommunications, Multimedia, and Applied Computing.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the requirements of the program was to get an internship
and I wound up working for Silicon Graphics part-time. I couldn&apos;t
have asked for a cooler company to work for at the time and it gave
me a nice entry to the industry. I went from Silicon Graphics to
Hewlett-Packard for six months and then on to Network
Appliance.&quot;</p>
<p>Joel is a systems engineer at Network Appliance, Inc., a network
storage company headquartered in Sunnyvale with almost 5,000
employees. Joel&apos;s first position with the high-tech company
involved analyzing customer storage requirements, &quot;architecting&quot;
solutions, and coordinating with the sales department to sell the
solutions. He&apos;s since moved on to a senior position where he makes
sure that engineers who work for Network&apos;s resellers are well
trained on the company&apos;s technology, competitive products, and
relationships with customers. His territory includes Northern
California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.</p>
<p>&quot;Working for a company that&apos;s growing provides opportunities to
change jobs within the company,&quot; says Joel. &quot;I&apos;m currently
contemplating moving within the company to a national or global
position as an encryption and security specialist.</p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s most fulfilling when I can take a concept or technology
and work on how to really explain it to someone. When I see the
light bulb click on in someone&apos;s head, and they truly understand,
it&apos;s just great.&quot;</p>
<p>Joel also enjoys the wide range of people he meets. &quot;Over the
years, that&apos;s included everyone from dot-com system administrators
in San Francisco to the CEO of a Fortune 10 company.&quot;</p>
<p>Although successful in the company, Joel must endure long days,
much travel, and tight deadlines. Reflecting on this regimen, he&apos;s
not sure he wants to stay an employee forever.</p>
<p>&quot;In the future, I want to be my own boss and either run a
storage consulting firm or pursue one of my other hobbies.&quot;</p>
<p>While at CSUMB, he says, &quot;I was fortunate to have one or two
teachers who I really clicked with and who gave me some good advice
and direction. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of the
internship on my career. I already had plenty of work experience,
having taken seven years off before returning to school, but how
about being given the opportunity to go and network in my chosen
field and get a taste for whether I would really want too work in
that area? It was worth its weight in gold.&quot;</p>
<p>Joel was an early supporter and contributor to the Alumni Book
Drive. He recalls why: &quot;going to the CSUMB library to do research
on a number of topics and finding that it was a bit sparse.</p>
<p>&quot;As good as online references are, you don&apos;t see a lot of
e-books. Why aren&apos;t there many online textbooks? Being able to flip
through a chapter and find information because you remember that it
was at the bottom left of a page about a half-inch in with a
paragraph break two-thirds of the way down the page. That&apos;s why. I
just don&apos;t see that context being available electronically for a
long time. And you never need to recharge a book.&quot;</p>
<p>A resident of Pleasant Hill, Joel has been married for three
years. And while his career involves the latest digital technology,
he has other interests far removed from that of his livelihood. One
is fencing. He participates in U.S. Fencing Association matches and
was once named one of the top 32 fencers in the country. Another
hobby is making custom parts for his brother&apos;s Cobra kit car in a
machine shop at home.</p>
<p>Joel&apos;s career advice: &quot;Find something you enjoy-or is a means to
an end-of something you enjoy. Make sure it&apos;s something you&apos;re good
at or know you can become good at. Try not to do something that
makes you feel too comfortable in your position, because then
there&apos;s no challenge. Network, network, and network in your field!
You never know who will give you a related lead that takes you
somewhere.&quot;</p>
