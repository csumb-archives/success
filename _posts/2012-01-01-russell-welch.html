<p>Love
TV shows and movies that make you squirm?</p>
<p>So does Russell Welch, who turned his passion for all things
creepy into a career as an independent filmmaker and visual effects
artist for the hit TV show <em>CSI: Miami</em>.</p>
<p>A longtime horror and sci-fi fan, Russell discovered the stories
of H.P. Lovecraft just before his senior year. &quot;As I started
reading his work, it began to make so much sense to me why he is
considered the father of modern horror. Two of my favorite horror
films, <em>Alien</em> and <em>The Thing</em>, were very heavily
inspired by Lovecraft&apos;s work, and it shows,&quot; says Russell.</p>
<p>Taking his cue from Ridley Scott, Russell decided to create his
own film in the vein of Lovecraft. &quot;Two of his stories contained
the recurring concept of creatures coming forth from the ocean and
characters having to accept an unsettling destiny, so I felt
exploring a horror film with an aquatic theme would be exciting and
challenging.&quot;</p>
<p>Russell
spent the next year writing, shooting, and editing his film,
<em>The Crimson Robe</em>, as his Capstone project in the
Teledramatic Arts and Technology major. The film debuted at the
H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival last October and has played in several
festivals since. It tells the story of Keith Weller, a young author
who has been discovered alone and screaming on a remote island.
It&apos;s up to Detective Phillips to find out what happened on the
island -- was Keith captured by a cult of amphibious creatures, is
he a murderer, or has he simply lost his mind?</p>
<p>&quot;One of the biggest challenges in making the film actually
started with the writing process,&quot; says Russell. &quot;I had a ton of
big ideas for this project, but I was making a short film, not a
feature. It was tough condensing things down, but it resulted in
having more focus on the core elements of the story.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to having too many ideas, Russell also struggled
with too much footage. He explains, &quot;The editing process was also
very tedious given that we had shot a ton of footage and there were
so many different ways you could take it. The opening sequence in
the film was actually constructed in the editing room by taking
footage we had shot out at Point Lobos during the day and then
manipulating it to look like nighttime during a thunderstorm.&quot;</p>
<p>But like any true horror buff, Russell knew the monsters were
most important. &quot;The moment I saw one of our creature performers
decked out in full makeup, body prosthetics, and adornments, I had
this huge grin on my face and just knew that we had done something
very special.</p>
<p>&quot;Melissa
Lieurance, our creature effects lead, really pulled out all the
stops and did some fantastic work. I am forever in debt to her,
because without her skills and talent this project would have been
impossible to do.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, Russell shares credit with the entire crew, as well
as his Capstone advisor, Professor Enid Blader, and the staff and
faculty in the TAT department. &quot;This project would not have turned
out the way it did without them.&quot;</p>
<p>When not working on his film projects, Russell stays busy with
<em>CSI: Miami</em>. &quot;The most interesting part of the job is
pretty much the whole job: getting to do the visual effects for a
popular television show.&quot;</p>
<p>Russell loves the challenges that every new shot presents. &quot;No
two shots are ever the same. Even if the desired result is similar
to something we&apos;ve done before, there&apos;s always something unique to
the pathway reaching there.&quot;</p>
<p>Those thrills keep Russell going, and his plan for the future
includes more storytelling and filmmaking. So if you love a good
scare, look for Russell&apos;s name in the credits.<br></p>
