<h5>A use for fog</h5>
<p>Ever heard an annoying drip . . . drip . . . drip
from your rain gutter on foggy mornings? What if some of that water
could be put to use rather than wasted?</p>
<p>Greg Ruiz (far left, with Dan Fernandez), a December 2005 Earth
Systems Science &amp; Policy B.S. graduate, devised an experiment
to answer that question. He<br>
set up three &quot;fog collectors&quot;-one on campus, two in Big Sur -- to
determine the feasibility of reclaiming useful amounts of water
from fog.</p>
<p>From July to December, he logged the amount of water collected,
then analyzed the data to see if the technology might be useful in
Monterey County. Although large amounts of water were not
collected, he concluded that such a system would prove beneficial
in irrigating a backyard garden.</p>
<p>The principle is simple: moisture-laden fog collects on mesh (in
Ruiz&apos;s experiment, about three square feet) and condenses into
water, which trickles through a tube into a container. Commercial
fog collectors -- such as those used to augment domestic water
supplies in Chile, Oman and South Africa -- are much larger.</p>
<p>Dr. Dan Fernandez, associate professor in Science and
Environmental Policy, was the inspiration for the project. He had
read about the technology several years ago and wondered if the
simple concept could be adapted to help with the area&apos;s water
needs. The results of Ruiz&apos;s work provided that answer.</p>
<p>Ruiz&apos;s project was funded by a National Science Foundation
Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) scholarship. The goal of
the scholarship program is to increase the number of
underrepresented minority students in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics and to help those students prepare for
graduate school.</p>
<p>Six CSUMB students have earned AMP scholarships in the last two
years. Last summer, students used the scholarships to study at the
Scripps&apos; Summer Training Academy for Research in the Sciences, the
Hatfield Marine Center at Oregon State University, and Stanford&apos;s
Hopkins Marine Station.</p>
