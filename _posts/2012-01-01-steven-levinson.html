<p>In the eleven years
that Steven Levinson has been teaching at CSUMB, he&apos;s been involved
in almost every part of campus in some way. He&apos;s taught courses in
Teledramatic Arts and Technology, Service Learning, Visual and
Public Arts, and Liberal Learning, and been a guest lecturer in
Human Communication and Social and Behavioral Sciences classes.
He&apos;s also served as the interim project manager of the Soledad
Street Revitalization project, and workd as the director of
aquisitions for the Fort Ord Museum and Archive. His television and
radio projects have also put him in contact with people from almost
every CSUMB department. And if that isn&apos;t enough, he also serves as
the faculty advisor to several student clubs.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m a bit harder to define than other people on campus,&quot; says
Levinson. &quot;But I&apos;m very serious about cross-campus collaboration. I
cross a lot of different walls.&quot;</p>
<p>The potential to cross traditional campus boundaries sparked
Levinson&apos;s initial interest in teaching at CSUMB. He explains, &quot;I
was teaching video at San Francisco State when I went to a
conference and CSUMB had a table there. I looked through the
catalog and noticed this new department with this name I didn&apos;t
understand, but that had radio and television and theatre. I was
excited that all were in one umbrella, so I&apos;d be able to take
advantage of a lot of different kinds of work I had done.&quot;</p>
<p>While in earning his broadcast electronic communication arts
(BECA) degree, Levinson also began experimenting with the
combination of multimedia elements on stage. &quot;I&apos;d been involved in
theatre-in set design, tech support, and acting-with Teatro Latino
and Teatro Esperanza, two then-San Francisco-based Latino community
groups,&quot; says Levinson. &quot;I started to experiment with more than
your standard theatre production, with the incorporation of video
and cameras, the interactivity with the stage and the screen, which
is something we&apos;ve done a lot with here [in TAT] as well.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to theatre and media-making, Steven has also
utilized his background as a community-builder in his contributions
to CSUMB. &quot;My family was very involved politically. The whole
concept of community support and working with community
organizations, which is essential to this university, was natural
to me, because that&apos;s how I grew up.&quot; As an aspiring ten-year-old
artist and community activist in Berkeley, Steven even designed a
poster for one of the Black Panthers&apos; campaigns. &quot;It was Huey&apos;s
favorite poster, actually,&quot; says Steven.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn&apos;t a stretch for me to teach service learning, to try to
express ideas of social justice and the importance of community
work because it was just what I&apos;d always done. I didn&apos;t have to
learn service learning; it was a part of who I was when I got
here.&quot;</p>
<p>In Fall 2006, Steven brought those community building skills to
his role as interim project manager of the Soledad Street
Revitalization project in Salinas. This semester he returns to
Soledad Street in a new role: &quot;This particular semester I am
teaching a class for the Service Learning Institute itself, doing
oral histories of Soledad Street, Chinatown, and Japantown, making
contact with the primarily Chinese and Japanese people who
historically have lived in that neighborhood, and actually
recording oral histories of the Asians who have lived there the
last 30-50 years.&quot;</p>
<p>Whatever the subject, Steven approaches teaching from a
problem-solving perspective. &quot;I try to get students to learn enough
so that they can handle the problem rather than just answering the
question,&quot; says Steven. It&apos;s a technique that he learned one of his
professors and mentors, Nancy &quot;Sammy&quot; Reist.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember at one point I was having a problem with an audio
board-I wasn&apos;t hearing some signal and I asked, &apos;What&apos;s the
problem?&apos; She said, &apos;Look at the board.&apos; She wouldn&apos;t answer the
question; she just said, &apos;Look at the board.&apos; I had almost exactly
the same situation with a student who was having almost exactly the
same problem-a certain button was pushed that was limiting what you
could hear elsewhere on the board. It was almost the exact same
conversation I had with that student that Sammy had with me fifteen
years ago. The first few years when I was teaching, whenever there
was an issue I would stop and think, &apos;What would Sammy do in this
situation?&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>Because of this approach, Steven has become a mentor to his
students in the same way Sammy served as a mentor for him. He
remains in contact with many of his former students and has built a
strong TAT alumni network by organizing formal and informal alumni
events. &quot;I was down [in L.A. recently] and we had a little bowling
party, 20 to 25 people showed up, but it was a real spread-people
who graduated in &apos;98, people who hadn&apos;t graduated yet, people
looking for jobs, people with jobs, people in a position to hire.
It was just a chance to sit with each other, find out what we&apos;re
doing, have fun, and potentially network about real job
possibilities.&quot;</p>
<p>Steven&apos;s wide-ranging interests do perhaps make him difficult to
define, but his overarching commitment to collaboration,
connection, community, and learning serve him well in his many
endeavors. By crossing traditional boundaries, Steven has
synthesized a successful career and made a difference that can be
seen in the success of his students and on just about every part of
campus.</p>
