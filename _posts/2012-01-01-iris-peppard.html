Meet Iris Peppard, one of Monterey County&apos;s 2007
Women of the Year.
<p>Iris received this honor from the Monterey County Commission on
the Status of Women for her work organizing the Everyone&apos;s Harvest
~ Marina&apos;s Certified Farmers Market and coordinating the Soledad
Street Community Garden Project.</p>
<p>&quot;I really feel that everybody has the right to have access to
local and organic produce,&quot; says Iris, a mission she lives out
every day.</p>
<p>When Iris started college, she admits she was all over the
place. When she transferred to CSUMB, she found a way to make that
work for her through the Integrated Studies Special Major. Her
focus was on community organizing. &quot;I took classes from six
different departments,&quot; she says. &quot;I liked Integrated Studies
because it allowed me to be self-directed. I really had to think
about what I wanted to do, and then figure out how to get
there.&quot;</p>
<p>A year and a half before she graduated, Iris struck on what she
wanted to do. Her classes related to nonprofit work,
entrepreneurship, and social justice, so for her Capstone she
resolved to create a nonprofit certified farmer&apos;s market in Marina.
&quot;I felt Marina lacked a free public event that happens on an
ongoing basis. I really think it is important for every
neighborhood to have a free public space to come together. Marina
is the seventh most ethnically diverse city in the United States.
It deserves a weekly event where people can come together. &quot;</p>
<p>Over the next year, Iris worked on setting up the Everyone&apos;s
Harvest as a certified 501c3 corporation and organizing the opening
day of the farmers market. She also made sure that the market could
accept food stamps and WIC, so that low income families could
participate and purchase fresh local produce. Two weeks after she
graduated, Everyone&apos;s Harvest celebrated its grand opening as
Marina&apos;s Certified Farmers Market.</p>
<p>Working as executive director of Everyone&apos;s Harvest has been a
steady part-time gig ever since, which Iris has supplemented by
working for other organic farms in the area. Then, in 2004, she
took on the role of outreach coordinator for Return of the Natives,
a plant restoration program run by CSUMB&apos;s Watershed Institute.</p>
<p>&quot;Laura Lee Leink, the director of Return of the Natives, was a
great mentor for me. She consulted with me during my Capstone, and
then I wound up working for her,&quot; says Iris. &quot;Her advice to me was,
&apos;listen to the community.&apos; This advice lead me to starting the
farmers market in Marina. While working for Return of the Natives,
I saw how Laura Lee passed on her excitement about planting native
plants to locals in Salinas. Her enthusiasm and skill to empower
other has really expanded my work today.&quot;</p>
<p>After spending a year with Return of the Natives, Iris took the
opportunity to work with the Service Learning Institute on the
Soledad Street Revitalization project. &quot;I really like the garden
project on Soledad Street because it allows folks who haven&apos;t been
given much opportunity in life the chance to gain organic farming
experience and job skills.&quot;</p>
<p>As garden coordinator, Iris organizes the daily activities of
the nine garden employees, half of whom are currently homeless, and
half of whom are very low income. &quot;This project allows local
community members to improve the Salinas Chinatown area.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to providing job training opportunities, the garden
also supplies fresh organic vegetables to Dorothy&apos;s Kitchen, where
they are served to other currently homeless and low income people
in need of a healthy meal.</p>
<p>Reflecting on all she has accomplished, Iris acknowledged the
spark that made it all possible: &quot;I am proud of my belief in
positive envisioning. Before anything great happens someone needs
to have a dream, a vision of something better. It is so important
to have these visions. A positive envision does not guarantee the
reality of a dream but without it, it does guaranteed the dream
will not be a reality.</p>
<p>&quot;When I began the process of starting the market I had a dream.
I didn&apos;t know if it would survive but I didn&apos;t let that stop me
from dreaming and acting on that dream-and now that dream is a
reality. The same thing with the garden: a year ago it was just an
idea and now it is a place where vegetables, flowers, and dreams
grow.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Iris for sharing her vision of affordable,
accessible, local, and organic agriculture with our
communities.<br></p>
