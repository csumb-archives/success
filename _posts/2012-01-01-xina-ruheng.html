<h5>From China to CSUMB-and back</h5>
<p>China is the most populous country in the world. With
well over 1.3 billion people-and much of the country rural-there&apos;s
a need for schools and teachers.</p>
<p>With her Master of Arts in Education degree from CSUMB, Xina
Ruheng is helping to provide educational opportunities for children
in her homeland.</p>
<p>She hails from Luguho Lake in China&apos;s Yunnan Province, near
Tibet. She returned to her homeland after earning a master&apos;s degree
in education-the first student from China to earn a degree from
CSUMB and the first of the Mousou people, a matriarchal society, to
earn an advanced degree from an American university.</p>
<p>Ruheng faced some early roadblocks. &quot;When I was six, I started
elementary school,&quot; she said, &quot; but they didn&apos;t have a school for
the Tibetan language, so I had to study Chinese.&quot; She went on to
learn English by age 11.</p>
<p>Because there are few schools in rural China, she was forced to
travel 375 miles from home to attend high school. Merely being
selected to attend high school is an honor; Ruheng was one of only
a handful of students from her area to do so. While there, she
distinguished herself as a top student.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of my classmates in elementary school didn&apos;t even finish
junior high. After three years, I took the entrance examination for
college and got the highest score in my county. I decided to attend
the Central University for Nationalities in Beijing. Four years
later, I graduated with a journalism degree.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1999, during my freshman year in Beijing, I was selected by
the school to visit Washington, D.C. and New York City,
representing Chinese college students. It was a very impressive
experience for me. When I got back to China, I thought about going
abroad to study for a couple of years.&quot;</p>
<p>After hearing good reports about the university, Ruheng decided
to attend CSUMB but faced culture shock at first.</p>
<p>&quot;When I arrived at CSUMB, I was only one of two Chinese
students. When I first got here, I couldn&apos;t figure out the menu
choices in the Dining Commons.&quot; She ended up eating cookies for a
week but, with the help of other students, she soon adapted to
campus life.</p>
<p>Pursuing a master&apos;s degree in education was an easy
decision.</p>
<p>&quot;As a volunteer (in China) during my summer vacation, I went to
a village to do some teaching for a couple of months. It was
disappointing. Most kids don&apos;t have a chance to get more
education.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt I needed to do something for them. That&apos;s when I decided
to get into the education field. I want to do something to help
people get educated.&quot;</p>
<p>Ruheng is now the director of administration for the TANY
Holding Group in Beijing. &quot;I help my company (an investment bank)
run a foundation to help poor students get an education. What they
are doing is to help talented students, like those who play piano
or violin very well-mostly arts majors. I suggested also doing
something for people who really need help, like poor students. They
agreed. I plan to take students trying to get the most basic
education, mostly very poor students in the west of China.</p>
<p>&quot;I made a lot of friends at CSUMB, and they wanted me to stay. I
could not be here for just myself-I needed to go back and do
something for my people.&quot;<br></p>
