<h5>Dig this career</h5>
<p>A community college class and a chance meeting with an
interested and dedicated professor changed Renee Cannon&apos;s life.</p>
<p>Cannon works at the Museum of Indian Arts &amp;
Culture/Laboratory of Anthropology in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It&apos;s
her job-and her passion.</p>
<p>But Santa Fe is a long way-geographically and
intellectually-from where her career began.</p>
<p>After dropping out of college, Renee took a job with American
Medical Response (AMR), the largest private ambulance company in
the nation. Her job responsibilities increased until she was in
charge of maintaining staffing levels on all paramedic emergency
ambulance units for Santa Clara County.</p>
<p>While her career with AMR was a success by any measure, she
yearned to finish the college education she had started 20 years
earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;I decided to enroll in an introductory anthropology class at
Gavilan College [in Gilroy],&quot; she says.</p>
<p>When she expressed a fascination with the subject, her
instructor suggested she visit Mission San Juan Bautista, where Dr.
Ruben Mendoza and his CSUMB students were excavating.</p>
<p>&quot;I met with Dr. Mendoza and was impressed that he was willing to
spend time with me, explaining his work at the mission.&quot; After
spending many afternoons digging for artifacts with Dr. Mendoza&apos;s
students, she was convinced that her future was in archaeology.</p>
<p>After graduating from Gavilan, she briefly attended San Jos&#xE9;
State University but decided that CSUMB would be a better fit for
her.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though CSUMB was a new university-with growing pains-it
was the only one in the area that offered a semester-long, hands-on
archaeology program.&quot; She graduated in 2000 with her Social and
Behavioral Sciences B.A.</p>
<p>Next stop: graduate school at CSU East Bay, where she earned a
master&apos;s degree in spring 2005.</p>
<p>While in graduate school, she continued to work during the
summers at San Marcos Pueblo in New Mexico through the American
Museum of Natural History. She started this work while an
undergraduate. Her interest in the pueblo had been piqued after she
and her husband purchased property nearby.</p>
<p>After graduation, they sold their house in Hollister and built
their dream home in Santa Fe. Renee volunteered at the Museum of
Indian Arts &amp; Culture, work that led to her fulltime position
as assistant collections manager for the individually catalogued
collections at the museum. She also volunteered with the National
Parks Service, doing archaeological site assessments.</p>
<p>Renee works with Antonio Chavarria, who studied under Dr.
Mendoza when the professor taught at the University of Colorado.
Chavarria is the museum&apos;s curator of ethnology.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Mendoza mentioned Tony several times as an example of what
a student could achieve following graduation,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>Renee believes her greatest accomplishment was going back to
school to earn bachelor&apos;s and master&apos;s degrees. She&apos;s quick to
credit the Social and Behavioral Sciences Department-namely,
professors George Baldwin, Manuel Carlos, Sandra Pacheco, and Ruben
Mendoza-with encouraging her to attend graduate school.</p>
<p>And she has a special fondness for her experience at CSUMB.</p>
<p>&quot;An education at CSUMB promotes self-esteem, team building, and
community awareness in all of its students. I can&apos;t say enough
about how proud I am to have been a student at this campus.</p>
<p>&quot;And the networking connections I made armed me with confidence
to pursue work in archaeology and museums. Passion for archaeology,
love of the Southwest, perseverance, patience, and a few lucky
breaks got me where I am today.&quot;</p>
<p>She sums up her second career this way: &quot;It&apos;s a great feeling to
get up in the morning and go to work doing something you love.&quot;</p>
