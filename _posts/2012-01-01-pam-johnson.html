<h5>Doin&apos; the &quot;math thing&quot;</h5>
<p></p>
<p>When Pam Johnson arrived at CSUMB, she had no idea what she
wanted to pursue. In freshman calculus, Pam &quot;got a push from my
professor. It just went from there. I&apos;m really into the math thing
now.&quot;</p>
<p>And the math thing keeps her incredibly busy. During the school
year, Pam works as a TA in lower division math classes, helping
students and assisting in grading papers. &quot;The last couple
semesters I&apos;ve gotten kind of close with some of the students and
they ask me to do private tutoring or go to their study
groups.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year, Pam was <a href="three-mathketeers.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a member of the student team</a> that won
the second-highest honor in the National Competition in
Mathematical Modeling. She plans to compete again this year-her
third and, as a senior, her last chance to win the highest honor.
&quot;I&apos;d really like to get that outstanding recognition.&quot;</p>
<p>Pam also is a member of the math club, which she confesses is
&quot;more social. We got together and talked about nerdy stuff. You see
the same people in all your classes, so that makes it a pretty
tight community.&quot;</p>
<p>At the center of that community is <a href="hongde-hu.html" rel="nofollow">Hongde Hu</a>, Pam&apos;s math professor and mentor. &quot;After
calculus I took multi-variable calculus, and that&apos;s the first class
I had with Hongde. In high school, I always liked math and it was
my favorite class, but I wasn&apos;t great with it. I didn&apos;t fully
understand the concept. It&apos;s great to work with Hongde because in
everything we do, he has a way to twist it around and put it in a
different perspective so we can understand it. He has all his own
proofs-he doesn&apos;t look at the book at all. He just shows us
everything. I can&apos;t imagine doing this with any other teacher.&quot;</p>
<p>With Hongde&apos;s guidance and scholarship support from the Louis
Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Pam is of American
Indian heritage), the driven 20-year-old senior is now getting a
head start on her Capstone project and thinking about jobs and grad
school for next year. For the Capstone, she hopes to delve further
into probability matrices. &quot;I&apos;ve just had a little experience with
them. I just did a final project for one of my classes on them, but
I want to go deeper. I thought they were really interesting.
There&apos;s so much to it, I just want to learn more about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Pam says she wants to get her master&apos;s degree in statistics
while working as an actuary. &quot;There are companies out there that
will start you out with your BA and then pay for you to go get your
master&apos;s.&quot; She thinks her first position may be with an insurance
company.</p>
<p>Even with all her involvement in the math thing, Pam finds time
to work and pursue her other interests. Growing up in Imperial
Beach, just five miles north of the Mexican border, she
participated in a marine science program and competed on the swim
team. Pam stays close to the water by working the front desk at the
Spanish Bay Club in Pebble Beach. There, several club members have
asked her to teach swim lessons to their children on the side&#x2026;and
she found a seventh grader in need of some algebra tutoring.</p>

student. She is now in graduate school at the University of
Southern California.</p>
