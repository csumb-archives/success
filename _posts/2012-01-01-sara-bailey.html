<p>Want
living proof that dreams do come true for those dedicated enough to
pursue them wholeheartedly? See Sara E. Bailey, who has carved out
a career for herself in the highly competitive music industry.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ve known I wanted to work in music for a really long time,&quot;
says Sara. &quot;I chose CSUMB because they provided a music and
recording technology program. Only a few California state schools
have it-Chico is one and their program was impacted. At CSUMB, I
could do my own thing and have access to the equipment with
professional assistance from professors who actively work in the
industry.&quot;</p>
<p>As a student, Sara made good use of the equipment-she founded
Fog Box records and worked with Associated Students to create two
albums featuring CSUMB student musicians and other local artists,
Unexploded Ordinance in 2005 and the follow-up release Out of Order
in 2006.</p>
<p>For her Capstone, Sara took the label to a new level, developing
the first full length CD by a single artist, A. Lee, who had tracks
featured on the two previous Fog Box releases. &quot;I had a staff of
ten who worked diligently to get all the ins and outs of the label
ready. For the final Capstone presentation we had an album release
party at Monterey Live.&quot;</p>
<p>Monterey Live sold out both nights of the release party, making
the Capstone a tremendous success by all accounts. Sara also began
working as a talent buyer for Monterey Live, which afforded her
another insight into the music industry.</p>
<p>Following graduation, Sara took a job with Paradigm, formerly
Monterey Peninsula Artists, a booking agency whose roster includes
established acts like the B-52&apos;s, Chris Isaak, Dave Matthews Band,
and the Black Eyed Peas, as well as the Cold War Kids, Brandi
Carlile, G. Love &amp; Special Sauce, Apollo Sunshine, and Cowboy
Junkies.</p>
<p>&quot;I work as a contract administrator, issuing legal documents for
large scale concerts internationally,&quot; says Sara. Though she&apos;s
getting great experience, the job is time consuming and
challenging. &quot;I work long hours. I&apos;m what you&apos;d call a workaholic.&quot;
She also has a side job booking the U.S.-Canada tour of the Bay
Area group Chow Nasty.</p>
<p>Her new responsibilities for Paradigm have put future Fog Box
releases on hold for the time being. &quot;We&apos;ve redirected the focus
for our artists from recording to touring and playing shows,&quot; says
Sara. Despite her hectic schedule, Sara plans on reviving Fog Box
on an even larger scale in the future.</p>
<p>It&apos;s almost all music in her spare time, too. &quot;On weekends I go
to concerts and local shows to support our local music scene. I&apos;m
still very plugged in to what&apos;s happening at Monterey Live.&quot; The
part that isn&apos;t music? &quot;I like to play air hockey at Monterey
Lanes-but that&apos;s a new development.&quot; She also enjoys drinking
cappuccinos and solving crossword puzzles with her fianc&#xE9; Matt
Bollwinkel (MPA &apos;05)</p>
<p>As for the future, Sara feels confident. &quot;Anywhere in the music
industry is a somewhere I want to be. It is my dream to one day be
an agent, but I&apos;ll do anything as long as it&apos;s in music. I see a
lot of room for growth, a lot of potential.&quot;</p>
<p>To others who might dream of following in her footsteps, Sara
offers this advice: &quot;When you go into a scary major-like a music
major where your parents assume it will be hard to find a job-it is
a huge relief to be able to land that dream job right out of
school. It&apos;s pretty phenomenal. But I&apos;ve seen it happen for a lot
of students coming out of CSUMB.&quot;</p>
