<p>Success Stories ~ Marcela Vargas</p>
</td>

<p>As the child of an immigrant family from Mexico,
Marcela Vargas has faced a variety of challenges.</p>
<p>She came to the United States when she was 16, not knowing any
English, but eager for the promise of joining American society.</p>
<p>Her biggest obstacle was learning the language. Since no one in
her family spoke English, she had no one with whom to practice.
&quot;Those first months were the most demanding, knotty, and
challenging,&quot; she said. &quot;Sometimes, I felt very desperate and lost,
but I never gave up.</p>
<p>&quot;My parents work in the fields, so they didn&apos;t know how to help
me. Besides that, after school I went straight home to cook for my
family and do the house chores before they came back from work.</p>
<p>&quot;And I worked a part-time job that took most of the time I
needed to do homework.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the hardships and challenges, she completed Alisal High
School in seven semesters.</p>
<p>Some months after starting at Alisal, &quot; . . . I was named
Student of the Month,&quot; and that &quot;became my motivation to continue
working even harder,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Graduating from Alisal with a 3.5 grade-point average, she
entered CSUMB and did even better - compiling a 3.89 GPA in her
first semester.</p>
<p>Marcela is CSUMB&apos;s nominee for the 2007 William Randolph
Hearst/California State University Trustees&apos; Award for outstanding
achievement. She was selected from a competitive pool of students
for her exceptional academic performance and commitment to
education and community service.</p>
<p>Marcela plans to major in Collaborative Health and Human
Services because &quot;I want to help low- income families learn about
the resources and benefits available to them.&quot;</p>
<p>She enjoys performing community service. &quot;I volunteered to
construct a playground in Salinas for the children of migrant
workers, in order for them to have a recreational place to use as a
family. And I volunteered to give information about the High School
Equivalency Program to people who are interested in obtaining their
GED.&quot;</p>
<p>Marcela&apos;s personal goals are mainly about her parents. &quot;I want
to get an education to help them&quot; financially, she said. &quot;They are
getting older, and they are already suffering the consequences from
their hard work in the fields, such as back problems. I want to
give back a little of what I accomplished thanks to them.</p>
<p>And, &quot;I&apos;m the first in my family to go to college; I would like
to be a role model for my brother, who&apos;s a senior in high
school.&quot;</p>
<p>She&apos;s adamant about her educational path. &quot;I plan to graduate
from CSUMB in four years and pursue a master&apos;s degree. For my
career, I want to become a nurse or a nutritionist because I have a
great interest in health and in helping people overcome their
challenges in life.&quot;<br>
<br>
CSU Trustees will hold an awards presentation Sept. 18 for the
Hearst scholars - students who have demonstrated financial need,
experienced personal hardships and have attributes of merit,
including superior academic performance, exemplary community
service and significant personal achievements.</p>
<p>One of them will receive a $6,000 scholarship; some of them will
receive $3,000 awards.</p>
<p>CSUMB students have had success in the Hearst competition in
recent years. The last two nominees - <a href="http://success.csumb.edu/daniel-delacruz" rel="nofollow">Daniel
Delacruz</a> in 2005 and <a href="http://success.csumb.edu/adriana-pacheco" rel="nofollow">Adriana
Pacheco</a> in 2006 - were each awarded $3,000.<br></p>
