<p>Tyler Birkestrand is majoring in Teledramatic Arts and
Technology, but he&apos;s finding his niche in modeling. And with it, a
way to help pay for his education.</p>
<p>Birkestrand, 22, recently completed a photo shoot in San
Francisco for a print ad promoting the 2007 Mercury Milan. The ad
appears in the December issues of Lucky, Allure, GQ, Details,
Rolling Stone and Elle. He&apos;s also done work for Mervyn&apos;s, Levis,
Ben Sherman, and has appeared in an ad for Business 2.0 magazine.
And, he&apos;s done runway shows in San Jose, and one in Monterey for
the Concorso Italiano car show.</p>
<p>A senior scheduled to graduate in the spring, Birkestrand has
always been interested in pursuing a career in modeling, but didn&apos;t
know how to break into the business. He got started once he landed
at CSUMB.</p>
<p>&quot;I did know that I should first have some portfolio shots, so I
contacted a photographer in the area and worked with her for a good
six months, developing different looks. I needed various shots of
me with long hair and short hair,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The photographer sent the shots to agents in San Jose and San
Francisco and arranged a meeting with each of them. I signed with
both, and I&apos;ve been with them ever since.</p>
<p>&quot;Modeling can be fun,&quot; Birkestrand said. &quot;It&apos;s sort of a rush
for me. I love meeting new people and seeing the finished product
of my work. Every shoot or show is different and is very
fast-paced. That&apos;s what makes it exciting.&quot;</p>
<p>Before anyone gets the idea that it&apos;s all fun, Birkestrand is
quick to point out that it&apos;s hard work, too.</p>
<p>&quot;Scheduling and time management are probably the most
challenging parts for me, especially since most of the work is in
San Jose and San Francisco. And I have to make sure my portfolio is
up to date . . . so I end up working with a photographer every
couple of months so my image stays current. I also try to stay fit,
working out as often as I can.&quot;</p>
<p>Its proximity to the ocean - among other reasons - brought him
to CSUMB.</p>
<p>&quot;I came here for several reasons: It was one of the less
expensive CSU campuses; I was accepted into the Summer Bridge
program; and it&apos;s far enough but not too far away from home. This
way, I can get home on a weekend if I&apos;d like - it&apos;s about three
hours away. I also wanted to give the ocean a try,&quot; said the
resident of Twain Harte, a small town in the Sierra foothills.</p>
<p>Modeling has been a way to help cover the cost of school fees,
plus extras like a new computer and bike. And it&apos;s something he
anticipates pursuing more seriously after he finishes school. It
will help fill in the gap while he searches for career
opportunities in line with his degree. Ultimately, he would like to
do something that combines his TAT degree with his minor in
journalism and media studies - a career in broadcast journalism,
perhaps.</p>
<p>&quot;After graduation, I may move to San Francisco or a bigger
market such as Los Angeles, New York or Miami. I think my
experience modeling will also provide a great opportunity for me to
travel . . . maybe try out some of the markets in Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>In the meantime, he continues to pursue a degree, play indoor
soccer, surf and snowboard in addition to the modeling gigs.</p>
<p>Professional success has not spoiled Birkestrand. Until this
year, when his schedule got too crowded with 20 units of classes
and his capstone, he worked as a student assistant in the
University Center, where Lianne Minemoto was his supervisor.</p>
<p>&quot;He&apos;s quiet, shy,&quot; said Minemoto. &quot;He&apos;s just a really nice
guy.&quot;</p>
