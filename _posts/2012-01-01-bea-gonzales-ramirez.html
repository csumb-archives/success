<h5>An educational whirlwind</h5>
<p>Though it seemed unlikely for a while, education has become an
important touchstone in Bea Gonzales-Ramirez&apos;s life. Bea decided to
drop out of high school after her sophomore year. It didn&apos;t take
long for her to realize that she wouldn&apos;t get very far without an
education, so she re-enrolled and earned her diploma.</p>
<p>Following high school, Bea did take some time off to raise her
family, but in 1992 she decided it was time to get back in school.
She enrolled in Galivan College, which led to what Bea describes as
&quot;a whirlwind of education.&quot; After three years at Galivan, she
decided to enroll at the just-opened CSUMB, where she found herself
becoming something of a celebrity.</p>
<p>She was selected to be the student speaker at inauguration
ceremonies for the new campus, on Labor Day weekend of 1995. Bea
shared the podium with President Clinton, then-White House Chief of
Staff Leon Panetta, Congressman Sam Farr and other dignitaries.</p>
<p>&quot;That experience changed my life,&quot; Bea recalled some years
later. &quot;After all the publicity, I felt like a poster child for the
university.&quot;</p>
<p>Bea majored in HCOM and graduated in 1997. Immediately, she
enrolled at Monterey College of Law and spent the next four years
earning her J.D., all while balancing her family life with a
husband and two kids.</p>
<p>&quot;After graduating from law school, I jumped right into teaching
at Heald College, where I stayed four years. As a teacher, I strove
to give back the energy that was given to me by my own faculty at
CSUMB when I was a student there. When I saw the spark in the eyes
of my students that other instructors had seen in me, I nurtured
it.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to teaching, Bea continues to nurture students as a
substitute teacher and Hollister School District trustee.</p>
<p>She ran uncontested for a school board seat in the fall of 2006,
and was allowed to pick anyone she wanted to swear her in. She
chose Mike Sanchez, who, as principal of a continuation school she
had briefly attended, had helped her turn her life around.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m so thrilled to do this and I&apos;m so happy for Bea and her
family,&quot; Sanchez told the Hollister Free Lance newspaper. &quot;To be
able to see a student stand next to the President of the United
States, and then to come back and be a Hollister School District
trustee, it&apos;s just an incredible feeling.&quot;</p>
<p>After the whirlwind, Bea has this advice for students: &quot;Take it
all in-the educational experience, the friendship experience, the
social experience. Then pick and choose what you want to make you
whole once you earn a degree. Enjoy getting an education, but don&apos;t
forget to enjoy the journey along the way.&quot;<br>
