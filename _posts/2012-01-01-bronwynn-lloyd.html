<p>&quot;When you discover something, you are reconnected to
the past,&quot; says Bronwynn Lloyd, a student in her final year at
CSUMB who will graduate in spring 2008.</p>
<p>While growing up, Bronwynn absorbed her dad&apos;s passion for
history. Before she left home to attend CSUMB, she chose marine
biology for a major, but it didn&apos;t take long for her to shift to
the archaeology concentration within the Social and Behavioral
Sciences major.</p>
<p>&quot;The first archaeology course I took involved me in a dig at
Carmel Mission,&quot; she said. At that point, she was hooked. Later,
she worked with CSUMB Professor <a href="ruben-mendoza.html" rel="nofollow">Ruben Mendoza</a> on a dig at the Royal Presidio Chapel.
&quot;I learned a lot from working on that project. It&apos;s a bit of a
puzzle, trying to fit the pieces back together, but that&apos;s the fun
of it.&quot;</p>
<p>Spending long hours searching for artifacts isn&apos;t easy. &quot;There
are times you go out on a dig but don&apos;t find anything. It may be
discouraging, but it helps us better understand the history of an
area. It explains the topography and the kind of environment there
was at the time. &quot;</p>
<p>Last year, Bronwynn was hired as a paid intern in the
archaeology lab of the district office of the California State
Parks Department in Monterey. The job is a perfect fit to continue
her work in the field.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ll be in England this summer working on two excavations,&quot; she
said. &quot;Through the Earthwatch Institute in South Shields, I&apos;ll be
working on the Roman fort there. At the University of Sheffield&apos;s
West Halton Field School, I&apos;ll be working on a Saxon settlement.&quot;
Sheffield is also the university Bronwynn wants to attend for
graduate school.</p>
<p>&quot;History, as it&apos;s passed down through the years, can be
manipulated and changed. But when you can bring up the evidence
that supports history, you bring into focus what actually happened,
as opposed to what probably happened.&quot;</p>
