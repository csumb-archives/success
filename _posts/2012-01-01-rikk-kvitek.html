<h5>Undersea expert creates one-of-a-kind research opportunities
for students</h5>
<p>Thanks to Dr. Rikk Kvitek, CSUMB professor and leading expert in
seafloor mapping, humanity can now more fully explore life
underwater and all its secrets. And the people doing the first
round of exploring? Many are CSUMB students.</p>
<p>Rikk has raised millions of dollars to build a science program
at CSUMB that exceeds what many universities-even those with Ph.D.
programs-could ever hope to offer. Aboard CSUMB&apos;s
specially-equipped research boats the Van Tresca and the
MacGinitie, students study marine habitats up and down the west
coast. Student research expeditions have even traveled as far as
Alaska and Antarctica. &quot;That&apos;s the great fun-taking students around
the world doing cool stuff,&quot; says Kvitek.</p>
<p>Rikk describes their research as &quot;the study of culture,
economics, and politics interacting with nature.&quot;</p>
<p>But the hands-on education doesn&apos;t end when students return to
shore. Again, thanks in part to initial funding from a $2.5 million
grant co-authored by Rikk, Bill Head, and Beverly Grova, students
have an extraordinary learning space on campus: the
state-of-the-art Chapman Science Academic Center.</p>
<p>The skills and experience students gain while working with
Kvitek often translate into immediate jobs after graduation. &quot;The
jobs that students can get right out of school with the skills they
have learned at this university are something that most
undergraduates are incapable of achieving,&quot; says Rikk. Many go into
careers in geospatial technologies or geographic information
systems with organizations like the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration or the California Department of Fish and
Game.</p>
<p>Kvitek received his Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of
Washington and became a research associate at Moss Landing Marine
Labs. In 1996, he joined the faculty at CSUMB. Since coming to
CSUMB, Rikk has raised over $7 million dollars for different
programs in marine science-last year alone he brought in 12 grants
totaling over a million dollars.</p>
<p>The CSU system acknowledged Rikk&apos;s contributions in 2004, making
him the first CSUMB faculty member to receive the Wang Family
Excellence Award in Natural Sciences. The award is designed to
&quot;celebrate those CSU faculty and administrators who, through
extraordinary commitment and dedication, have distinguished
themselves by exemplary contributions and achievements in their
academic disciplines and areas of assignment.&quot; Then-president Peter
Smith summed it up this way: &quot;What Rikk has accomplished in the
short life of this university is nothing short of remarkable. He is
committed to students and faculty working together on real research
projects. He writes the grants, gets the funding, recruits the
students, and does the work.&quot;</p>
<p>Because of Rikk&apos;s incredibly successful fundraising efforts,
large numbers of students are receiving the opportunity to
participate in this amazing research-and use the best seafloor
mapping technology available. Due to their efforts, one day
humanity may have as much understanding of the seafloor as we do
the terrestrial areas of the planet. And CSUMB&apos;s professor Rikk
Kvitek and his students will have paved the way.</p>
