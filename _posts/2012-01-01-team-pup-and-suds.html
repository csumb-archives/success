<p>Apple wasn&apos;t kidding when they named the Insomniac Film
Festival.</p>
<p>Four teams of CSUMB students braved the 24-hour production cycle
creating a short film to enter in the contest. For one group
calling themselves Team Pup and Suds, the sleepless night paid off
-- their film, <em>Smile</em>, placed in the top 25.</p>
<p>The annual contest challenges student filmmakers to produce a
three-minute-or-less film using a Macintosh computer and software.
Teams are allowed to plan ahead, but to guarantee that the filming
and editing take place in just one day, Apple releases a list of
required elements (think camera angles, character names, locations,
and props) the morning the competition opens. Teams choose at least
three of these elements to include in their film.</p>
<p>The TAT students, all graduating seniors in the midst of
Capstone projects, had too much else to do to start planning ahead
of time. True to the spirit of the competition, they didn&apos;t even
begin thinking about the project until Apple released the list of
elements.</p>
<p>Dane Bergerson, the de facto team captain, explains, &quot;We waited
until Apple released the list at 7 a.m. and then brainstormed for
the next two hours.&quot; Once the group settled on a concept, Dane and
Cody Campbell began on the script. &quot;We decided to follow a single
main character and not have any dialogue. If you&apos;ve got dialogue it
has to be good or you&apos;ve got nothing. With so little time, we
decided it was better not to do dialogue,&quot; says Dane. Meanwhile
Haley Pikhart, Adam Newacheck, and Derek Tekus set off to find
supplies.</p>
<p>They hit up six area stores and spent close to $200. &quot;We went
crazy in the 99 cent bins at Target,&quot; says Adam. The big score came
from CSUMB favorite Last Chance Mercantile: six full clown suits
for only four dollars. Last Chance also came through on hospital
scrubs, a costume that initially posed a challenge -- the uniform
store the team visited earlier in the day sold them at a
budget-busting $60.</p>
<p>The team spent the remainder of the day shooting in East Campus,
incorporating a park bench, a Dutch angle shot, and a character
named Robin Darjeeling -- elements from Apple&apos;s list. They also
threw in a dream sequence and match cut for good measure. The team
took one short break to drive through Jack-in-the-Box, still fully
costumed in the clown suits.</p>
<p>Apple&apos;s tight timeline left no time to stop, so when Adam backed
his equipment-laden van into his friend&apos;s car -- a friend who also
happened to be producing his Capstone -- he called out a quick
apology and kept driving.</p>
<p>In true CSUMB fashion, the project was highly collaborative.
Though Derek stars as Robin Darjeeling and Adam did most of the
camera work, everyone appears in the final scene and each team
member lent a hand in the editing process. They finished up around
4:30 a.m. &quot;We were livin&apos; on Monsters,&quot; laughs Derek, referring to
the energy drink.</p>
<p>The resulting film tells the story of a washed up clown haunted
by his past.</p>
<p>After uploading <em>Smile</em>, the group went into guerrilla
marketing mode. The top 25 films are chosen by fan rankings, so Pup
and Suds went to work, utilizing their online social networks. &quot;We
used MySpace, Facebook, and Open Forum -- basically just spammed
all our friends and family,&quot; said Derek. They also put a teaser up
on YouTube: a 30 second snippet of the movie followed by two
minutes showing only the contest URL.</p>
<p>This approach garnered enough viewers to crack the top 25, an
impressive feat considering 3,000 teams entered the contest. As a
finalist, <em>Smile</em> was reviewed by industry professionals
including Jim Sheridan (<em>My Left Foot</em>, <em>In</em> <em>the
Name of the Father</em>), Nora Ephron (<em>When Harry Met
Sally</em>, <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em>), and Fred Armisen
(Saturday Night Live). Though they didn&apos;t take the top prize of
MacBook Pros loaded with all the software any videomaker could
desire, they did score a huge fanbase, get some great industry
exposure, and six clown costumes.</p>
<p>Not a bad trade for one sleepless night.<br></p>
