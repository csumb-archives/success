<h5>Science alum mans NOAA research vessel</h5>
<p>After completing his bachelor&apos;s in Earth Systems
Science &amp; Policy, Jason Mansour graduated from basic officer
training of the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps. NOAA, short for
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is a uniformed
service of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Ensign Mansour took his
first assignment as an officer aboard the 215-foot NOAA fisheries
research ship Miller Freeman, based out of Seattle.</p>
<p>New NOAA Corps recruits, who must have degrees in science,
engineering, or mathematics, learn all aspects of ship management
before they begin tours aboard NOAA vessels. Once assigned to a
vessel for the first two-year tour, each officer works with a
senior officer on the bridge and begins specialized training in
hydrographic surveys, fishery research and trawling, or oceanic and
atmospheric research.</p>
<p>&quot;I would be sitting with the officers and crew from the fleet
over formal luch and I&apos;d throw out terms like multibeam bathymetry,
caris hips, subset editor, or isis and I&apos;d make thier eyes grow
wide. No one had ever heard of an officer who had actual
hydrographic experience being assigned to a fishery research ship
as was the case with me. They would immediately ask how I knew
those terms (as most anyone outside of the hydrographic fleet
doesn&apos;t), and I&apos;d simply reply that I had the chance to do
hydrographic research with the Seafloor Mapping Lab at CSU Monterey
Bay,&quot; says Jason.</p>
<p>Scientists board the fishery research vessel to perform trawling
or surveying of a certain section of the ocean floor. The ship&apos;s
officers, including Mansour, take the scientific party to the
location where it needs to conduct its research.</p>
<p>&quot;Through my ESSP experiences and education, I found myself well
prepared for the broad range of challenges that NOAA offers a young
officer,&quot; said Mansour. &quot;From learning how to navigate the ship, to
working with a complement of crew and officers from very diverse
backgrounds, to multi-tasking operations at once, the classes and
instructors within ESSP gave me the knowledge, skills and
discipline to do it all.&quot;</p>
<p>Mansour hopes to continue his career with NOAA until retirement.
He recently completed the NOAA flight training program and achieved
his lifelong dream of becoming a professional pilot.</p>
