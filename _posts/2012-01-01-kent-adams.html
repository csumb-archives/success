<p>&quot;I am sitting here
today because of a barbell,&quot; says Kinesiology professor Dr. Kent
Adams.</p>
<p>An avid weightlifter who competed in private clubs, Adams
started college pursuing a degree in business. When a family friend
told him he could make a career out of the study of strength, he
changed majors and whizzed through school, studying with leading
experts in the field and earning his Ph.D. from Oregon State
University at a young age (see photo of college-age Adams and his
wife, fellow professor Patricia Sevenne-Adams, below).<br>
<br>
&quot;Exercise physiology-don&apos;t make the mistake, it is not about
playing with a ball. We are physiologists who look at how exercise
impacts health and fitness throughout the lifespan,&quot; explains
Adams. His research does cover the lifespan-everything from
childhood obesity to osteoporosis in the elderly. Adams&apos;s passion
for the subject is apparent, and he&apos;s eager to share his work with
students through the newly approved Kinesiology concentration in
exercise science.</p>
<p>&quot;I consider myself
to be a teaching researcher. I&apos;m very enthusiastic and I love
teaching students, but I also love involving them in research so
they are at the cutting edge. I want to get students involved in
the research process with their Capstones and also with research
that applies to the community, such as research on aging and
performance.&quot;</p>
<p>Already, he is working with students to build a new exercise
physiology lab where these studies can take place.</p>
<p>&quot;My goal is to give students who want to work hard this
definable outcome of presentations and publications that matter
when they look at graduate schools, that matter when they look at
careers in the health and fitness industry.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to the new lab, Adams&apos;s efforts have led to CSUMB
becoming the fourth school in California to be recognized by the
National Strength and Conditioning Association for having a
Strength and Conditioning Curriculum. &quot;These credentials are
recognized across the country and the globe,&quot; says Adams.</p>
<p>Adams also has plans to promote a healthier campus environment
for all CSUMB community members. Using body monitoring technology
supported by a WeTEC grant, Adams and his students will calorically
map the campus-figuring out how many calories are burned walking
from building to building.</p>
<p>This sort of work illustrates just one opportunity for improving
fitness in simple day to day activities. Adams explains, &quot;That is
what we are trying to do with our students-give them the knowledge,
skills, and abilities to go out in the community and appropriately
design quality fitness programs for kids, for older adults, for
people with diseases and disabilities.&quot;</p>
<p>Helping people lead healthier lives can seem a daunting task,
but Adams is unfazed. &quot;I&apos;m very lucky that I can do something that
I am so fired up about every day. The challenges pale.&quot;</p>
