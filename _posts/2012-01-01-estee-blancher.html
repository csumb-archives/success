<h5>Katrina&apos;s aftermath: real-life education</h5>
When Estee Blancher came to CSUMB in the spring of 2002, she knew
that her New Orleans roots would one day be the focus of the
filmmaking skills she hoped to acquire as a student in the
Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department. She wanted to make a
film that would capture the culture of her hometown, its stories,
and the personalities who populate the place.
<p>Then Hurricane Katrina ravaged the city in the heart of the
Mississippi River Delta, and everything changed for her.</p>
<p>On September 18, 2005, the 29-year old junior packed up a bus
with filmmaking equipment and aid supplies and headed to Louisiana
to document the devastation, and to help in any way she could.</p>
<p>&quot;This fits in with my studies,&quot; said Blancher, who earned six
credits making her documentary. &quot;I couldn&apos;t finish my semester and
be 100 percent here, anyhow, given everything that&apos;s happened. And
I&apos;ve always wanted to document my culture and these stories.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope it&apos;ll be an educational piece and an emotional journey,&quot;
she said a few days before her departure.</p>
<p>&quot;The people are tired and traumatized, and they really need
help. I love my home, obviously. Anyone who&apos;s from that area is
heartbroken.&quot;</p>
<p>Blancher documented the stories of the people who were affected
by the hurricane. She focused on thier next steps-abandoning the city,
or staying and trying to rebuild.</p>
<p>According to Steven Levinson, one of Blancher&apos;s teachers, &quot;She&apos;s
expanding her teledramatic skills and serving the community.&quot; He
added that her personal connection allows her to document people&apos;s
lives in a way that an outsider couldn&apos;t. &quot;She&apos;ll have people
opening up to her.&quot;</p>
<p>Blancher traveled with a crew of six: friends, professional
documentary filmmakers, and a freelance journalist. She plans to
update her website (<a href="http://www.filmkatrina.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.filmkatrina.com</a>) with progress
reports.</p>
