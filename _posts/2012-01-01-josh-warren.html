<p>It&apos;s
hard to box Josh Warren in. He&apos;s a computer technician, journalist,
community advocate and semi-pro basketball player. He&apos;s also
weighing the option of Harvard for graduate school.</p>
<p>Josh came to CSUMB from the San Francisco in 2003 for two simple
reasons: &quot;I was recruited to play basketball and the school seemed
like a good fit, being heavy in technology. I was always interested
in technology.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, those interests still define Josh&apos;s life. He works as a
senior technician for Auto Warehousing, a company in Tacoma, Wash.,
that manages the import and export of vehicles. &quot;Vehicles are
shipped to the U.S, from overseas in containers. We pull them off
the boats, add accessories, allocate them and get them to the
dealerships,&quot; Josh says.</p>
<p>That process requires a lot of technology, which Josh works to
keep running from the corporate office. &quot;I help oversee the
computers and phones, and support users in 26 facilities-including
three in Canada and one in Mexico,&quot; Josh says. &quot;It&apos;s really pretty
critical to the company&apos;s success.&quot;</p>
<p>He credits his education at CSUMB for giving him the ability to
adapt to the demands of his job.</p>
<p>&quot;The Information Technology and Communication Design major gives
you a good foundation in all computers,&quot; he says. &quot;The cool thing
about CSUMB is they teach you how to teach yourself and learn. In
school I was more into multimedia and design, but now my job is
more technical, more administration and hardware. The major gives
you the background, teaches you the logic.&quot;</p>
<p>Josh, who graduated in 2005, also minored in journalism, and
after arriving in Seattle he put his journalism skills to work for
the urban magazine SeaSpot. &quot;Music was my main focus,&quot; he says. &quot;I
wrote album reviews and got to interview famous people like Russell
Simmons.&quot; Though he no longer writes regularly for the magazine, he
does occasionally do some freelance work for them.</p>
<p>Outside of work, he still spends a lot of time on the basketball
court, playing point guard for the Jazz of Tacoma, a semi-pro team
competing in the International Basketball League.</p>
<p>Before joining the Jazz, Josh volunteered for the Seattle
chapter of the NAACP, where he helped organize a group of high
school students to compete in the Afro-Academic, Cultural,
Technological and Scientific Olympics (ACT-SO). The ACT-SO program
encourages high academic and cultural achievements among high
school students and gives these students a venue for
recognition.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to keep advancing yourself,&quot; he says. &quot;Be a part of
the community and help out.&quot;</p>
<p>Up next Josh is considering graduate school, specifically a
one-year program through the Harvard School of Education. CSUMB
professor Valerie Landau recommended him to the program, he says,
&quot;But I&apos;m not a 100 percent sure.&quot;</p>
<p>Though he isn&apos;t sure what that next step will be, Josh is
certain he&apos;s followed the right path.<br>
&quot;I&apos;ve got a good job that I like with a growing company,&quot; he says.
&quot;I&apos;ve got sports. I can&apos;t complain.&quot;<br></p>
