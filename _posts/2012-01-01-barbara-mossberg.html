<p>Teacher, thespian,
poet, environmentalist, lecturer, scholar-Dr. Barbara Mossberg is a
living example of integrated studies and the potential for
interdisciplinarity. Or, as she describes it, living purple.</p>
<p>&quot;Purple is the color of Integrated Studies.&quot; says Barbara (or
&quot;Dr. B,&quot; as her students call her), who directs the IS program at
CSUMB. &quot;Just as red and blue make purple, purple represents the
creativity which is forged through the fusion of arts and sciences
and the disciplines that make up our students&apos; academic dream
plans. &quot;</p>
<p>One example of Barbara&apos;s purple lifestyle is her scholarship on
the life of Sierra Club founder John Muir. In numerous articles,
public presentations, and an upcoming book, Barbara examines how
Muir, a geologist, used language arts to influence environmental
public policy. &quot;I have a particular interest in how humanities and
arts express and shape values and ideas about our environment which
become public policy and legislation.&quot; Taking fusion one step
further, Barbara is tying this research in to a theatrical
production: &quot;I&apos;m writing a musical which interweaves how the ways
artists and writers have portrayed trees intersect with politics
and public policy.&quot; Though at first that may seem like a stretch,
Barbara&apos;s puts in simply: &quot;Drama is a way to bring all the
different disciplines together.&quot;</p>
<p>Drama has been a lifelong interest for Barbara. As a young girl,
she wrote and performed plays in her neighborhood. &quot;I invited the
neighbors to my little shoebox theatre and then the front yard
Little Theater and sold lemonade and cookies.&quot;</p>
<p>For the past 30 years she has been performing a series of her
own one-women plays based on Emily Dickinson, the subject of
Barbara&apos;s award-winning book and much of her scholarship and
international lecturing. Another recent theater credit includes a
starring role as Lettice in the Carl Cherry Center for the Arts
production of Lettice and Lovage.</p>
<p>&quot;This play is a tribute to education and to educators,&quot; says
Barbara. &quot;Lettice takes it upon herself to educate everyone...she
is a helpless educator. She cannot help using every moment as an
opportunity to excite passion for what there is to know. She makes
each moment a teaching moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps Lettice
isn&apos;t so far from Barbara herself. She began her academic career
teaching drama and literature at the University of Oregon. Later,
Barbara&apos;s teaching career expanded to include an international
appointment as senior Fulbright distinguished lecturer at the
University of Helsinki where she continued teaching American
literature and drama as bicentennial chair of American studies.</p>
<p>Over the course of her career she won teaching awards from every
university she&apos;s been associated with up to now (including several
more Fulbrights) and served as president of Goddard College, a
title she retains as Emerita.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department recognized her educational leadership
and appointed her U.S. Scholar in Residence to represent American
higher education in the U.S. and around the world. She&apos;s lectured
and consulted for countless educational, governmental, and
nonprofit organizations, proving that she&apos;s willing to take on
almost any subject in any setting and make it a teachable moment.
After all, it just deepens her purple hue.</p>
<p>Barbara&apos;s leadership role promoting ideas about an integrated
education &quot;for the whole person, the whole life, the whole world&quot;
led to her serving as senior fellow for the American Council on
Education for college and university leaders, including for the
Center for Institutional and International Initiatives, and the
Office of Women.</p>
<p>Her educational vision of &quot;treating with reverence each other
and the earth&quot; drew her immediately to CSUMB&apos;s Vision, and once on
campus, she was drawn &quot;like a moth to a flame&quot; to the Integrated
Studies program. Based on her educational philosophy and values,
she seeks to empower both students and faculty to embrace their
various interests and curiosities and synthesize those ideas into
meaningful educational plans.</p>
<p>&quot;The students burst into my office with an ambitious agenda
fueled by their own conscience and idealism and practical goals for
how to make a difference in their world. I ask them, what
experiences, abilities, skills, and knowledge do you need to play
this role? We consider our whole CSUMB curriculum, faculty, and
programs as the canvas on which to draw. We are a team that fosters
the ability to be purple, so that they can be the full, whole,
complex, coherent learners they are and that our society so
needs.</p>
<p>&quot;The Integrated Studies program,&quot; Barbara says, &quot;&quot;is the &quot;don&apos;t
settle zone. If a student is interested in art, digital design,
marine mammal education, Japanese, and scuba, and wants to work on
international aquarium-based public environmental education, this
major says, &apos;you are not Cinderella&apos;s ugly stepsisters, trying to
cut off your toes and heels from a perfectly splendid foot to fit a
little glass slipper of some prince single major. We have a program
which accommodates your complexity.&apos;&quot; She adds, &quot;For me, part of
the pleasure is working with our interdisciplinary faculty, who
make my purple mind feel so at home.&quot;</p>
<p>Barbara&apos;s scholarly and lecture projects include works in
progres on integral education of &quot;ancient wisdom and emergent
knowledge,&quot; the role of classics in multicultural education,
American cultural studies, integral leadership, and her own poetry
and photography. She gives poetry readings, and lectures locally
and nationally in theaters and educational centers and Yosemite
National Park (a recent environmental-rousing talk was in a barn
with horses looking on!), including keynoting Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
<p>Wanting to support both arts and environmental education,
Barbara is on many local community boards, including serving as
president of the Forest Theater Guild, and is devoted to Restore
Hetch Hetchy.</p>
<p>&quot;My life is definitely purple. I tell my mother, who worries at
how busy I am, it&apos;s a beautiful life, because I love all the colors
that make it up, every part of what I am doing.&quot;</p>
