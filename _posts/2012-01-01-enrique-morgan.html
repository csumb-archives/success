<p>Enrique &quot;Kike&quot; Morgan&apos;02 spends at least half his
time traveling. &quot;I know a lot of airports by heart,&quot; laughs Kike.
As the regional sales manager for the Americas with Constellation
Wines, Kike oversees all of the company&apos;s interests in Mexico, the
Caribbean, and South America. Before that, he was responsible for
Canada and Asia, and spent his time studying the wine markets in
China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s a cool opportunity to learn about different marketing
styles. You have to understand who the consumer is and the
difference in how wine is consumed in different markets,&quot; Enrique
explains. &quot;For example, in some places, people only drink wine
during dinner. In &apos;wine drinking countries&apos; like Chile, Argentina,
and Brazil, it&apos;s more of a casual drink, not just for celebration
the way we drink wine in the U.S. For more casual drinkers, we
tailor wine profile to be sweeter with a lower price point. Asia
was all about sweet wines, and they were more interested in the
health benefits.&quot;</p>
<p>Kike got into the wine business immediately after graduation
from CSUMB. He started in sales at Gallo Winery, but left to pursue
an opportunity with Constellation. &quot;I liked the industry but wasn&apos;t
into sales aspect. I wanted to do international business because of
my background and education.&quot;</p>
<p>Kike was born in Chile in a town called Casablanca near
Santiago. After his parents divorced, Kike&apos;s mother remarried an
American who lived in Chile. In the early nineties, the family
decided to relocate to the United States and wound up in Auburn,
California. Kike&apos;s father and other relatives still live in Chile.
Kike decided to come to CSUMB because of his sister, Carolina
Morgan, who was part of the pioneer class. He majored in Management
and International Entrepreneurship, now called Business
Administration, and minored in Global Studies.</p>
<p>Kike credits Professor John Kim as a primary mentor. &quot;John made
a point to teach about international and cultural sensitivity-that
what you see is not always what you get, but to approach problems
with objectivity and try new things out and go for it. He&apos;s a great
mentor and person to be with.&quot;</p>
<p>Indeed, Kike feels that the education he received at CSUMB
really prepared him for the growing field of international
business. &quot;It goes to prove that you can go to Harvard or one of
the big schools-I run into those people all the time-but it&apos;s not
about that. It&apos;s about what you put forward; it&apos;s how you combine
what you learn and apply it to your current situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Currently, Kike is working to bring wines made in New Zealand
and Australia into the South American market. In January, he spent
10 days in Australia with a group of Brazilian wine distributors
touring wineries. &quot;I&apos;m working to educate Brazilian customers about
wines from around the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Kike&apos;s aggressive travel schedule makes finding personal time a
challenge. &quot;My idea of a good weekend is staying home to relax.&quot;
Fortunately Constellation encourages him to bring his family with
him on trips. His girlfriend, fellow CSUMB alum Christy Clark,
joined him in Australia, and Kike occasionally squeezes in one of
his favorite hobbies in some of the most beautiful locations around
the world. &quot;I was certified as scuba diver at CSUMB, so whenever
I&apos;m in Australia and the Caribbean I go diving on the weekend.&quot;</p>
<p>Though he doesn&apos;t get much opportunity to rest, Kike is pleased
about his choice of career. &quot;[It] is the way of the future. There
is only so much you can do internally. Exponential growth has to
come from abroad. The way different markets interact with each
other and how that is managed dictates the success of a lot of
people.&quot; Himself included.<br></p>
