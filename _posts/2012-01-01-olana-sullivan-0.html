<p>There
are many ways to meet CSUMB&apos;s language requirement. You can spend
time in the classroom and in the WLC language lab, you can test
out, or you can immerse yourself if the language and culture as
part of a study abroad experience.</p>
<p>Human Communication major Olana Sullivan chose the latter. She
took advantage of a partnership between CSUMB and Cabrillo College
to travel to Buenos Aires, Argentina, as part of an exchange
program with the Universidad de Belgrano.</p>
<p>&quot;I needed to meet the CSUMB language requirement, but I also I
wanted to take the opportunity to see a different part of the
world,&quot; says Olana, who grew up in the Monterey Bay area. &#xA0;&quot;I
also&#xA0;wanted to&#xA0;learn more conversational
Spanish.&quot;&#xA0;</p>
<p>She joined a group of thirty students from CSUMB and Cabrillo
who spent four weeks over the summer in Buenos Aires. Olana stayed
with a host family and took small, intensive language classes at
the university each morning. &quot;My class had eight people&quot; she says.
&quot;It was one of the largest.&quot;</p>
<p>The Universidad de Belgrano, named for the barrio in which it is
located, hosts a number of exchange programs in addition to
teaching local students, so Olana had the opportunity to meet other
students from all over the world.</p>
<p>After class, Olana headed out to explore the city, her Lonely
Planet travel guide in hand. &quot;I explored the museums and botanical
gardens, and the different barrios and outdoor markets.&quot; she says.
&quot;You really get to know yourself when you travel abroad.&quot;</p>
<p>Her favorite destination was Recoleta, a neighborhood
distinguished by French-style architecture and numerous parks,
cafes and galleries. &quot;Recoleta has a huge outdoor market with lots
of Argentinean arts and crafts, mate gourds and all kinds of Che
Guevara stuff,&quot; Olana says. &quot;I spent a lot of time just
exploring.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Olana returned to the home of her host
family. &quot;Before you go, you fill out a survey that asks things
like, &apos;Do you like pets? Are you vegetarian?&apos; Then they place you
with someone who can fill those needs,&quot; she says. &quot;I got placed
with a really cool family -- a mother and two daughters.&quot;</p>
<p>Olana says the accommodations were modest -- just a room with a
small bed and a shelf. &quot;Looking back, I grew a lot from not having
as many comforts,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;ve become more patient and less
high maintenance.&quot;</p>
<p>For
Olana, the highlight of the trip was a weekend excursion to Iguazu
Falls, one of several optional add-ons to the program. The falls,
among the largest in the world, are located north of Buenos Aires,
at the border of Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>The excursion started with a tour of Iguazu National Park, where
the students hiked out to cliffs overlooking the falls, followed by
a rafting trip. &quot;You&apos;re actually being sprayed by the water from
the falls and going through rapids,&quot; Olana says. &quot;It&apos;s a big
adrenaline rush.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, back in California, Olana remains glad to have studied
abroad: &quot;I got this experience and perspective outside of the U.S.
Iguazu Falls was the most amazing place I&apos;ve ever been. And I can
carry on a pretty good conversation in Spanish. I&apos;m so glad I
went.&quot;<br></p>
