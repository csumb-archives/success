<p>Do you ever hesitate when using your credit card to
make purchases on the internet? If you are like millions of
Americans who shop online regularly, probably not. CSUMB alum Troy
Ison &apos;05 is doing his part to keep you feeling comfortable and
confident when you click that &quot;Proceed to Checkout&quot; button.</p>
<p>Troy works for a company called Cybersource that &quot;handles
backend systems for credit card transactions over the Internet.&quot; As
an operations analyst, Troy makes sure the network and servers are
running properly and that the system&apos;s integrity remains intact. He
often works the graveyard shift, ensuring that your late night eBay
habit can continue without any billing issues-at least as far as
the payment technology goes. Unfortunately, he can&apos;t do anything
about that low-rated seller.</p>
<p>Troy knew this was the direction he wanted to head when he
entered Gavilan Community College. After Gavilan, Troy transferred
to San Jose State, but found that his classes didn&apos;t offer enough
&quot;real&quot; experiences. &quot;When I was at San Jose State, the only
networking classes they taught were theory-based, with no hands-on
time.&quot; So he made the decision to transfer to CSUMB &quot;because I was
looking for an exciting way to learn.&quot;</p>
<p>Troy majored in TMAC where he made an effort to get everything
he could out of his classes-and then some. &quot;Some of my teachers
took the time to work with me when I asked about topics that were
more advanced than the subjects covered in class.&quot;</p>
<p>Troy appreciated that his professors came from the technology
field. &quot;They were able to bring real world examples to the learning
process. The networking and Linux teachers were very helpful in me
succeeding at CSUMB.&quot; Troy went even further by working as a
student assistant in the ITCD lab, which gave him additional
opportunities to get hands-on experience working with Windows and
Linux servers.</p>
<p>Troy also found a way to use his tech skills and give something
back to the community. In 2004, he began working with the Monterey
Rape Crisis Center as his service learning partner. Initially he
came on to help them purchase new computers, but his role quickly
grew. &quot;I&apos;ve been their IT person since then. The people there have
become like a second family to me.&quot; Even now, Troy continues to
come down from his home in Mountain View to work at the center once
a month.</p>
<p>And even when he isn&apos;t working, Troy is connected to the latest
technology. &quot;I&apos;m someone who likes to play with electronic gadgets.
I always like to keep on the cutting edge.&quot; With his thirst for the
newest technology and love of hands-on learning, Troy will no doubt
continue to excel in the IT world. In the meantime, know that when
you click &quot;Add to cart,&quot; Troy is looking out for you.<br></p>
