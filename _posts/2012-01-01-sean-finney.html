<h5>Setting sail with NOAA</h5>
<p>Sean Finney is one of 14 men and women who recently graduated
from Basic Officer Training with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Commissioned Officer Corps. It&apos;s
a logical career path for an Earth Systems Science &amp; Policy
B.S. alum who had a concentration in Marine and Coastal
Ecology.</p>
<p>The NOAA Corps, a part of the U.S. Commerce Department, is one
of the nation&apos;s seven uniformed services. (The others are the four
military services, the Coast Guard and the Public Health
Service.)</p>
<p>A native of Monterey, Sean earned an A.A. from Denver Automotive
Diesel College. He has worked as a certified Audi mechanic and as a
crew chief for the RPMS Motorsports/Chiron USA racing team for 8
years. Sean also served in the Army Reserves.</p>
<p>NOAA Corps officers manage and operate the agency&apos;s fleet of 18
ships and 13 aircraft that are used to gather data and conduct
research for the agency&apos;s environmental science mission. The
officers can be assigned from Alaska to Antarctica. Their work can
involve exploring the face of a glacier or the depths of the sea or
flying into the eye of a hurricane.</p>
<p>Sean&apos;s first sea assignment was two years aboard the fisheries
research vessel David Starr Jordan, a 171-foot trawler based out of
San Diego. While serving aboard the David Starr Jordan, Sean
conducted fishery and living marine resources assessments off the
Pacific coast of the U.S. and Central and South America.</p>
<p>Now he&apos;s back on the Monterey Peninsula area coordinating vessel
operations for the research vessel FULMAR in the Monterey Bay
National Marine Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Officers assigned to a research ship receive specialized
training in support of NOAA&apos;s mission through participating in
fishery, oceanographic, atmospheric and hydrographic research.</p>
<p>&quot;CSUMB has provided me with a myriad of tools that, I believe,
will make me very successful in my career,&quot; Sean says. &quot;For
instance, the stand-alone projects (such as Capstones), allow you
the opportunity to develop essential skills such as leadership,
time management and the ability to work with outside agencies.&quot;</p>
