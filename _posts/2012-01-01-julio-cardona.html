<p>Here
at CSUMB, many students are among the first-generation of their
family to attend college.</p>
<p>This was the case for Lucia Cardona-Raya, who decided to earn
her college degree at age 40, becoming one of the original pioneer
Otters. She earned her B.A. in Liberal Studies in 1997, and then
continued on at CSUMB, earning her teaching credential and pursuing
a master&apos;s. Sadly, Lucia passed away due to cancer in 2001, shortly
before graduation. She received her master&apos;s degree in education
posthumously.</p>
<p>Lucia&apos;s oldest son, Julio, was inspired by his mother&apos;s
commitment to education. Though he already had a culinary arts
degree and had taken some courses at MPC, Julio decided to enroll
at CSUMB as a way to both honor Lucia and become a better role
model for his younger brother. Two years later he graduated with
his degree in Human Communication, becoming the very first
second-generation Otter.</p>
<p>Like his mother, Julio realized the enormous power of education,
and decided to devote his life to it. As a CSUMB student, he became
fascinated with the experiences of first-generation college
students and worked closely with Professors Rina Benmayor and
Cecilia O&apos;Leary on the First Generation College Student Archive, a
collection of the oral histories of first generation CSUMB
students. This experience as an undergrad ultimately shaped the
trajectory of Julio&apos;s career.</p>
<p>Following his graduation from CSUMB, Julio went on to Stanford
to earn his master&apos;s degree in education. &quot;What got me going was
working with the first generation research going on at CSUMB,&quot; says
Julio. &quot;I wanted to continue doing more research-based work on
access issues in higher education and looking at different
retention issues in college.&quot; For his master&apos;s thesis, he analyzed
academic support systems for first generation college students.
Today, he utilizes that expertise as the assistant dean of graduate
studies at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&quot;I love working with students, especially first-generation
students. To start with high school students and inspire them to go
to college, and then to continue on, so that they don&apos;t just go to
college and drop out, or go and get their bachelors degree, but
continue on, to hopefully get a master&apos;s degree and a Ph.D.&quot;</p>
<p>At UCSC, Julio oversees several programs that support graduate
students, particularly underrepresented students-first generation
students, students of color, and women-working on degrees in
science, math, technology, and engineering. &quot;Their research is
totally beyond me, but we work with them on everything other than
their research. We assist quite a few to retain them and help them
with their unique situations-sometimes these students are so busy
doing research and writing papers they lose track of some of the
other things, like how to do a CV, or how to perform in a job
interview,&quot; says Julio.</p>
<p>Through workshops and networking sessions, Julio combines social
activities with professional development opportunities. Julio
explains, &quot;At the grad school level there isn&apos;t much of a social
life, so we are trying to build that. It&apos;s different than what&apos;s
happening at the undergrad level, where there are a lot of
programs, dorm life, and activities constantly. But for grad
students, a lot of them are older, they have families, they feel
isolated because of their specialized research interests.&quot; These
workshops provide an opportunity to develop the professional
network that may be just as important to a successful career as a
strong research background.</p>
<p>In addition to his work at UCSC, Julio maintains a strong
connection to CSUMB. He teaches First Year Seminar, supporting
first year students by ensuring they know about all of the
different support programs and offices available to them at CSUMB.
&quot;I really wanted to make the students aware of what is available to
them now, rather than hear them say &apos;well, I didn&apos;t know&#x2026;&apos; later
on.&quot;</p>
<p>He has also organized opportunities for CSUMB students to meet
with UCSC graduate students and faculty, giving them the chance to
learn about various grad programs and get tips on how to apply.
And, as if all that weren&apos;t enough, Julio also serves on the CSUMB
Alumni Association Board of Directors as the newly elected Vice
President. &quot;My grounding was always working with these professors
and staying close to people who could provide me advising and
mentoring. Now, I want to be active and give back.&quot;</p>
<p>By following in his mother&apos;s footsteps, Julio made the
Cardona-Raya family a CSUMB legacy. Now, through his work at CSUMB
and UCSC, he continues to spread that educational legacy with a
wide range of students-from first year and first generation all the
way through to the Ph.D.</p>
