<p>Dr. Amalia
Mesa-Bains, co-director of the Department of Visual and Public Art,
has received another award, this one from her peers.</p>
<p>She has been selected to attend the annual Macondo Writers
Workshop, hosted by Sandra Cisneros, as this year&apos;s Milagro award
participant.</p>
<p>The award honors the late Gloria Anzaldua, a visionary and
leading voice in Chicana literature before diabetes led to her
death at 61. In Cisneros&apos; words, the award &quot;recognizes the role of
community in taking care of our own and of the importance of taking
time out to heal ourselves.&quot; It is given to a writer, ailing in
body, heart or spirit, who needs a place to heal and who could find
comfort surrounded by the Macondo community.</p>
<p>Award winners receive a week&apos;s stay in a bed-and-breakfast,
assistance with travel to San Antonio, and a few doses of
pampering.</p>
<p>Said Dr. Mesa-Bains, &quot;Sandra and many of the writers have been
aware of my long-term healing from the (car) accident (in 2003) and
the loss of my parents and illness of my sister.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of us in the Chicana community have spoken in depth about
the spiritual nature of these life events and one&apos;s creative
cultural response. It is in respect to this dialogue and my
&apos;miraculous&apos; healing that I was selected for the award.&quot;</p>
<p>The award is especially meaningful to Mesa-Bains, for several
reasons.</p>
<p>&quot;It means a great deal to be recognized by your peers. But, most
importantly to me is that the award is in the name of Gloria
Anzaldua. She was someone I admired a great deal and with whom I
had the good fortune to do a life-changing dialogue at Williams
College in 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;She has always been a scholarly inspiration as a Chicana
feminist and cultural activist. I&apos;m looking forward to the company
of writers and friends in a space of continued healing.&quot;</p>
<p>The Macondo workshop - named after the sleepy town in Gabriel
Garcia Marquez&apos;s &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; - was started in
1995 as a gathering of fiction writers, poets, journalists,
screenwriters and scholars working on geographic, cultural, social
and spiritual borders.</p>
<p>Each summer, Cisneros, author of &quot;Caramelo&quot; and &quot;House on Mango
Street,&quot; invites writers to San Antonio for workshops, nightly
seminars, camaraderie, critiques and support.</p>
<p>Cisneros told the San Antonio Express-News that when she moved
to San Antonio from her native Chicago, she sought out a &quot;literary
town center,&quot; a place where writers could meet, exchange
manuscripts and critique one another&apos;s work. When she didn&apos;t find
one, she decided to create one herself.</p>
<p>She started to think about it in 1984; the economic independence
that came with a MacArthur Foundation &quot;genius grant&quot; in 1995
allowed her to make it a reality.</p>
<p>This year&apos;s event will be held July 29 through Aug. 5 at Our
Lady of the Lake University.</p>
