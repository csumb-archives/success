<p>Following
his graduation from CSUMB, Daniel Lyons (&apos;04 SBS) entered the Peace
Corps and has been living and working in Mozambique ever since.</p>
<p>A beautiful country located in Southeast Africa alongside the
Indian Ocean, Mozambique gained its independence from Portuguese
colonial rule in 1975. Following independence the nation
experienced a civil war lasting until 1992 which displaced millions
of people from their homes. Making matters worse, in 2000, a
cyclone hit the country and caused the largest flood ever recorded
in Africa, leaving half a million people homeless.</p>
<p>Daniel&apos;s Peace Corps experience began with nine weeks of
intensive training in the village of Massaca. There, he took
intensive lessons in Portuguese and was trained on community health
issues, including working with adolescents, orphans and vulnerable
children, and people living with HIV/AIDS and their families.</p>
<p>After completing training, Daniel traveled to the island of
Incaha and began working with Habitat for Humanity&apos;s International
Orphans and Vulnerable Children Project.</p>
<p>The United Nations estimates that 17% of the population of
Mozambique is infected with HIV/AIDS and the majority of those are
women. The deaths resulting from AIDS have lead to an orphan crisis
and large numbers of vulnerable children who are left without
adequate shelter or, more often, homeless. In Incaha, Daniel
designed and implemented a project to build emergency housing for
these children.</p>
<p>During this process Daniel learned that the homes, built out of
cement blocks, cost too much for many members of the community and
that many existing homeowners struggled to make their mortgage
payments. With the help of another Peace Corps volunteer, Daniel
developed a new building method that utilizes a traditional
building material, the bamboo-like canico reed, reinforced with a
concrete foundation and zinc roof. This brought the cost of a house
down by 50 percent. Money from a donation-based intervention fund
further alleviated the crisis: Habitat was able to build homes
using the new design and only require residents to pay back 30
percent of the homes&apos; cost&#x2014;and residents were able to repay that
amount by working on construction of new houses.</p>
<p>As part of a related initiative, Daniel taught nutritional
gardening techniques to the women who lead households of orphaned
and vulnerable children. By growing and consuming vegetables like
beets and carrots that support the immune system, the families can
lead healthier lives. As an incentive, women who maintained gardens
and trained others in gardening techniques received mortgage
discounts.</p>
<p>In addition, Daniel worked with the local government, other aid
agencies, and community-based organizations in the area to build a
stronger welfare infrastructure in the region. As a result of these
partnerships, the village built a new HIV testing center and
developed a home-based care program.</p>
<p>In an effort to address the social aspects of the AIDS pandemic
in Mozambique, Daniel worked with two other Peace Corps volunteers
to organize an annual conference for young men from across the
nation called JOMA (Jovens Para Mudanca e Accao/Youth for Social
Movement and Action). During the conference young men examine the
cultural norms of Mozambique and identify unhealthy gender roles
and stereotypes, with the goal of encouraging positive behavior
changes. The men and their teachers then return to their home
communities and implement a project to share what they have learned
and promote healthier behavior among their peers.</p>
<p>Though the issues facing Mozambique will require work for years
to come, Dan has made an important and positive impact already.</p>
