<p>It&apos;s a good thing Mark Roman and Stacy Chin-Roman
have a healthy sense of adventure-Mark&apos;s Air Force career has taken
them halfway around the world to Okinawa, Japan, where he leads a
unit of 120 service members at Kadena Air Base. Mark&apos;s mission:
maintain and manage over $30 million worth of network
infrastructure supporting over 8,000 users. Currently deployed in
Southwest Asia, Mark is heading a night shift of 26 personnel who
respond to communications issues which could affect all aircraft
missions flown by U.S. and Coalition members in support of
Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.</p>
<p>As a communications officer, Mark has built on the range of
knowledge he acquired at CSUMB. Now, in addition to the network
skills he developed as a Telecommunications, Multimedia, and
Applied Computing major, he&apos;s responsible for a slate of
communication mediums, including postal mail, photography,
multimedia, cabling, telephone, satellite, radio, and airfield
landing systems. He also works on managing the storage, transport,
and recording of communications. &quot;I&apos;ve learned something every day
since day one,&quot; says Mark.</p>
<p>Mark also utilizes some of the communication, collaboration, and
leadership skills he developed through his involvement with CSUMB
Athletics. Mark pioneered the role of Sports Information Officer on
the campus by first volunteering to track statistics for the
basketball team, occasionally writing up game summaries, and
maintaining the Athletics website. Later this turned into a
part-time job, and today, this role has grown into regular,
fulltime staff position.</p>
<p>While busily attending classes, sporting events, and
courting his future wife, Mark never envisioned himself embarking
on a military career path. However, the idea of joining the Air
Force wasn&apos;t completely alien. &quot;My family had always been a
military one,&quot; says Mark. &quot;My father was a pilot in the Air Force
and had taken us across the world and U.S. with him. So the idea of
joining the military was in the back of my mind when I thought
about things after graduating.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark and Stacy married in 2000 and soon after began discussing
the possibility of an Air Force career. &quot;I knew I would be involved
in something bigger than me and that my family could see
interesting places that we wouldn&apos;t have imagined. I remember it
benefited me as a child because I never took things for granted as
I grew up. My wife and I were also explorers in a way, so we knew
we would make the most out of each stop in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark enrolled in the Air Force Officer Training School and began
an intensive three month boot camp. Near the end of his training,
the tragedy of 9/11 occurred and reinforced his desire to be a part
of something bigger than himself.</p>
<p>Stacy leveraged her student work experience at the Defense
Manpower Data Center on the former Fort Ord to land a job as a
civilian employee with the Department of the Air Force. As an
employee at the Air Force Personnel Center and the 18th Wing&apos;s
Military Personnel flight, she has directly impacted the careers of
thousands of military members.</p>
<p>Mark and Stacy have two children, Gavin and Lauren. Stacy
recently took some time off from her job with the Air Force to
focus on them and prepare the family for reassignment in September
2007.</p>
<p>&quot;I am blessed with this success as an officer not only because
of my experience leading individuals in athletic venues and the
challenges of being a TMAC student, but also because of the support
of my family,&quot; says Mark. &quot;CSUMB and the Air Force have made life a
wonderful adventure so far.&quot;<br></p>
