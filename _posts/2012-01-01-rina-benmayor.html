<p>&quot;I&apos;m all about storytelling,&quot; says HCOM professor Rina Benmayor.
Indeed, she has made a career out of unlocking peoples&apos; stories and
teaching her students to do the same. </p>
<p>Before coming to CSUMB, she was assistant professor of Spanish
at Stanford, and then became research director of Culture and Oral
History at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in
New York. There she headed a longterm research project,
interviewing Puerto Rican women who had emigrated to the U.S. and
recording their oral histories.</p>
<p>After 13 years at Hunter, Rina was ready for a change: &quot;I wanted
to go back into fulltime teaching, but I didn&apos;t want to go back
into a traditional Spanish department. I am very committed to the
Latino population and I saw CSUMB as a really nice bridge back into
teaching. It was exactly what I wanted to do: multidisciplinary and
committed to vision students.&quot;</p>
<p>When she arrived at CSUMB as part of the second wave of founding
faculty, she immediately jumped into planning a full curriculum for
the 600 students who would be arriving two weeks later.</p>
<p>&quot;I started out teaching a class I had designed in New York and
really wanted to bring out here-Latina Life Stories. It was
scheduled in an arms vault with a big, heavy metal door. The
students start out by reading autobiographical writings by Latinas
and then they write their own life stories so they become authors
as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Another element of the course involves theorizing the work and
connecting the stories to the larger world. &quot;I spent five years
researching different ways to have students do that. It became part
of my scholarly work and I&apos;ve written a couple essays about it,&quot;
says Rina.</p>
<p>Latina Life Stories became one of Rina&apos;s signature classes,
evolving over the years to incorporate new media such as video and
the internet. The result: three minute videos called digital
stories, presented online.</p>
<p>Now the class has
taken on a life of its own. Several CSUMB alumni have enrolled in
graduate programs at the University of Utah&apos;s School of Education,
and they recently invited Rina out to teach a workshop on creating
digital stories. &quot;They are going to propose the class for their
curriculum. It&apos;s the first time something I&apos;ve created has found a
new generation and it&apos;s tremendously satisfying to contribute
something that has a longer shelf life than just me,&quot; says
Rina.</p>
<p>Another of Rina&apos;s courses, Oral History, has also grown into a
scholarly resource. &quot;I decided to teach my oral history class
around a single topic.&quot; Rina chose first generation college
students because support for these students is a big issue in
California and her class could contribute to the body of knowledge
on the topic. &quot;Most of my students in those early classes were
first generation. They were the experts; they had the lived
experience, and they got to share that expertise with the
classroom.&quot;</p>
<p>The class partnered with campus support and outreach efforts
like Educational Talent Search and began interviewing area high
school students as well as CSUMB students. At the end of the
semester, the classes presented their findings to the campus
community. &quot;We wanted to give the university a report card on how
it was doing in the support of the first generation students,&quot; says
Rina.</p>
<p>With the interview subjects&apos; permission, all the student work
went into an archive and the classes have produced two websites
that draw on the student interviews and their interpretations of
those educational stories.</p>
<p>That repository came in handy a few years later when CSUMB alum
Julio Cardona was finishing his master&apos;s thesis at Stanford. &quot;It
was very satisfying to me that somebody used the archive for their
master&apos;s. It was important to build a public repository for anybody
in the area and to see it being used-I think the greatest
accomplishment is when you see something you put into place take
off and have a life of its own and go forward.&quot;</p>
<p>The oral history class continues to move ahead, exploring new
topics and more advanced technologies. But despite the changing
subjects and mediums, the heart of what Rina does stays the
same-it&apos;s stories she&apos;s after.</p>
