<p>&#xA0;Gilbert
Salazar was born to be a teacher.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m more comfortable in front of a class than sitting down as a
student,&quot; said Gilbert, who earned a degree in Integrated
Studies.</p>
<p>After graduating from high school in 2000, he joined AmeriCorps,
a domestic version of the Peace Corps. He was sent to Charleston,
S.C., where he tutored and mentored middle school students, worked
with Habitat for Humanity, assisted with disaster relief and helped
to build the Palmetto Trail. From there, he went to Walla Walla,
Wash., where he worked as a reading teacher and soccer coach at an
elementary school.</p>
<p>&quot;I needed to leave home to learn more about myself,&quot; Gilbert
said. One of the things he learned was that he had a passion for
working with young people.</p>
<p>His AmeriCorp service earned him $9,000 of education awards to
help pay for college.</p>
<p>Back home, he attended Riverside Community College. While
searching the web for a university where he could complete his
degree, he came across a page for CSUMB&apos;s Integrated Studies
Special Major. The university&apos;s emphasis on social justice, and the
flexibility of the integrated studies major appealed to him. He
enrolled in fall 2005.<br>
<br>
He put together a major he calls &quot;Communal and Global Education for
Peace and Justice,&quot; which combines classes in Human Communication,
Service Learning and Global Studies.</p>
<p>His Service Learning work took him to the Boys and Girls Club,
and to Sunrise House in Salinas, where he co-facilitated a program
called Youth Alternatives to Violence, an anger-management class
for middle school and high school students.</p>
<p>He also worked as a GEAR-UP tutor at Chualar School. GEAR-UP -
Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs -
is a federally funded program aimed at giving low-income students
the skills, encouragement and preparation needed for college.</p>
<p>A service learning class inspired him to think about gender and
how it defines people.</p>
<p>&quot;I got to the question of how does gender relate to violence and
what can be done about it. Through my experience working with the
Service Learning Institute, it&apos;s clear that poverty, oppression,
race and gender are all connected.&quot; That led him to his capstone
project, a curriculum he wrote to prevent adolescent male
violence.</p>
<p>Boys Empowered, Men Empowered - BE ME - is an eight-week
curriculum intended for 11- to 14-year-olds in an after-school
setting. &quot;Middle school is a critical age when young people are
transitioning from being a kid to being a young adult,&quot; Gilbert
said.</p>
<p>The program has a social focus (constructing awareness of self
with others); a physical focus (violence); and an emotional focus
(constructing awareness of self). Some of the lessons have been
tested on students at Chualar School, but as yet the entire
curriculum has not been presented in an after-school setting.
Gilbert is looking for an opportunity to do just that.</p>
<p>He spent several weeks in June teaching poetry and spoken word
to 10th graders for Imagine College on the CSUMB campus and tutored
a pre-algebra class at Gonzales High School. Beyond that, he has no
plans. He&apos;s applied for a position as a college facilitator for the
GEAR-UP program at Gonzales High.</p>
<p>&quot;I think of myself as a teacher. I&apos;ve soaked in a lot of
information,&quot; Gilbert said. &quot;Now it&apos;s time to use it.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to educate students in how to be a good human being.
This means teaching about race and class and oppression. Education
is more than No Child Left Behind.</p>
<p>&quot;A classroom should be an empowering place to be.&quot;<br></p>
