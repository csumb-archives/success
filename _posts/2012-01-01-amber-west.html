<p>As Amber West counts down the days until she graduates this
spring, she also counts off a series of struggles that she has
turned into successes-and it&apos;s quite an impressive list: &quot;First of
all, I am hearing impaired&#x2026;Second of all, I am the first generation
in my family to receive a B.A. degree. I am Native American and
registered in the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. My family has struggled a
lot to provide for us&#x2026;Third, I am majoring in Collaborative Health
and Human Services, concentrating in both social work and public
health&#x2026;Fourth, I am applying for graduate school and will
definitely be the first in my family to get an M.A&#x2026;.Fifth, I was
part of the Vagina Monologues last February&#x2026;Sixth, the most
important of all, my husband went to Iraq and was injured&#x2026;&quot;<br>
Amber&apos;s story begins in Lancaster, California, just outside of Los
Angeles. Amber&apos;s parents knew something was different about their
young daughter, but their doctor misdiagnosed her with poor vision.
Amber wore glasses for a year until her teacher picked up on the
fact that it was Amber&apos;s hearing, not her vision, that was
impaired. The teacher suggested that Amber see an audiologist, who
correctly diagnosed Amber at age six. &quot;I have no hearing in my left
ear and 60 percent hearing in my right ear,&quot; explains Amber.</p>
<p>Once diagnosed, Amber was pulled out of first grade and put in a
special education classroom to begin learning American Sign
Language. The teacher working with Amber presented her parents with
a difficult decision-did they want Amber to be part of the hearing
world or the deaf world? &quot;My parents wanted me to have the best of
both worlds, at least until I was old enough to make the decision
for myself,&quot; Amber says. So they fought-and won-a battle for Amber
to attend mainstream school with an interpreter.</p>
<p>By her senior year, Amber, who also reads lips, decided she
wanted to be more independent and stopped using the interpreter.
She continued her education without an interpreter until her junior
year at CSUMB, when she realized that the collaborative nature of
her major made it difficult for her to catch everything that was
going on in the classroom. She tried using an assistive device from
Student Disability Resources, but ultimately decided that she
preferred working with an interpreter.</p>
<p>Amber is majoring in Collaborative Health and Human Services,
focusing on both social work and public health. She wants to
continue on this dual path through graduate school (she&apos;s applied
to UC Berkley and San Jose State) and earn both Master of Social
Work and Master of Public Health degrees. Ultimately, she would
like to work to educate children about nutrition, obesity, and
related diseases. For her Capstone, Amber is leading a group for
11-13-year-old girls at the Salinas Boys and Girls Club. She hopes
to empower these young women and teach them about body image,
physical activity, and healthy eating.</p>
<p>Amber has also worked on campus to speak out against abuse
towards women. In February of 2006, she was part of the CSUMB
production of the Vagina Monologues, where she and her friend
Tiffany Ghiorso alternated signing the positive and negative
sections of &quot;The Village&quot; while a blindfolded woman spoke the
words. &quot;By signing it, making it so visual, it adds another really
powerful dimension to the performance,&quot; says Amber.</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest challenge Amber has faced was trying to
juggle school, work, and an internship while worrying about her
husband, Evan, who was sent to Iraq just two months after their
October 2004 wedding. Communication was extremely limited and even
when they managed to speak, the violence in the area kept their
conversations short. Once, while on the phone, Amber heard an IED
explode in the background near Evan. &quot;What was that?&quot; she asked,
but all she heard from Evan was, &quot;I gotta go,&quot; and the click of him
hanging up.</p>
<p>Evan was stationed at the Forward Operating Base (FOB) in Kalsu,
Iraq, and shortly after arriving there, he fell off of a Bradley
Fighting Vehicle and dislocated his shoulder. He popped the
shoulder back into its socket and never said much about it, but the
injury got worse and worse.<br>
Meanwhile Amber was still trying to attend class. &quot;I knew Evan was
working really hard over in Iraq, and that I needed to work really
hard here in school. I knew that&apos;s what he would want me to do. I
had to stay focused.&quot; It wasn&apos;t easy. &quot;I realized how emotionally
hard it was one day when my teacher asked, &apos;How are you doing?&apos; and
I just started crying in class,&quot; Amber recalls.</p>
<p>Eventually, Evan&apos;s sergeant noticed that Evan no longer had use
of his left arm. Unable to pass a basic physical test, Evan was
flown to Germany and then back home to Fort Irwin in California
where he underwent major surgery. Finally, in May 2006, Evan was
medically discharged from the Army and able to move up to Monterey
with Amber.</p>
<p>As Amber&apos;s countdown to graduation gets shorter and shorter,
she&apos;s looking forward to easier times ahead-being finished with her
B.A., living with her husband for the first time, and welcoming a
new companion into the family. &quot;I&apos;m getting a hearing dog next
summer,&quot; says Amber. &quot;I&apos;m so excited!&quot;</p>
