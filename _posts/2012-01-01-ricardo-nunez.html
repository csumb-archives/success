<h5>&#xA0;What comes around...</h5>
<p>Ricardo
Nunez has come more than full circle-he&apos;s in an outright spiral.
Upward, of course.</p>
<p>Born in Mexico, Ricardo emigrated to the U.S. at age 16 when his
mother, who had been living in California and working in the
fields, obtained a visa.</p>
<p>Ricardo went straight to work in a plant nursery, but after a
few months he came to a realization. &quot;I decided, no, I&apos;ve got to go
to school,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Though he spoke no English, he enrolled in North Monterey County
High School as a junior. One of the teachers, Mr. White, helped
Ricardo get his transcripts from Mexico, putting him on track to
graduate in two years. &quot;It was so frustrating because I didn&apos;t know
any words in English,&quot; says Ricardo. &quot;But a wonderful professor
helped me choose the right classes.&quot;</p>
<p>Following his graduation in 1999, Ricardo resumed work in the
fields. &quot;I thought that because my English was so limited, I
couldn&apos;t make it in a university.&quot;</p>
<p>One day, coming back from work, he was taken by surprise.
Waiting at his house was a mentor from the Summer Bridge program.
Created to close the gap between high school and college, Summer
Bridge brings students to live on campus over the summer and
prepare for their first year of college.</p>
<p>&quot;He was waiting at my house for me. He said, &apos;Ricardo, just pack
everything, we&apos;re going to go to Summer Bridge.&apos; I was like, &apos;Hold
on, hold on, I&apos;m not ready yet.&apos; He said &apos;I am going to wait an
hour here and you&apos;re going to get ready.&apos; That&apos;s how I ended up
coming to CSUMB.&quot;</p>
<p>Ricardo continued to struggle with English, but thanks to
friends and supportive faculty members like Professor Juan Jose
Gutierrez, he made it through, improving his language skills and
majoring in Liberal Studies with a minor in Spanish.</p>
<p>Two years after he began at CSUMB, Ricardo joined the faculty
mentor program as a lead mentor. &quot;I had to do the same thing my
mentor did because he made a big difference in my life. I had to go
out there and reach out to students the same way he did with
me.&quot;</p>
<p>Ricardo graduated from CSUMB in 2004 and decided to continue his
education by pursuing a master&apos;s degree in Spanish Literature from
San Jose State University.</p>
<p>A year into his master&apos;s program, he got a call from his old
high school. &quot;&apos;Ricardo, you&apos;ve got a job over here.&apos;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t even apply for a job,&quot; says Ricardo. &quot;They said,
&apos;You&apos;re going to be teaching class. I know you&apos;re in the M.A.
process, but we need you here. You need to help students get a
different picture.&quot;</p>
<p>And so, in the midst of grad school, Ricardo also began
teaching.</p>
<p>&quot;The first semester I struggled. Dealing with teenagers was
hard. You never know what to expect from a 14- or 15-year-old,&quot;
says Ricardo.</p>
<p>&quot;After the first semester I settled down. I became tougher-if
you become tougher, that&apos;s how they love you. I became famous in
the high school, everyone wanted to take a class with me.&quot;</p>
<p>Some students even apologized, retaking the class and promising
to work harder after Ricardo failed them the first time.</p>
<p>&quot;That maybe changed my life.&quot;</p>
<p>Before long, the phone rang yet again. &quot;It always begins with
calls,&quot; laughs Ricardo.</p>
<p>It was Professor Gutierrez, asking Ricardo to help launch a new
outreach program-this time to help educate parents so that they can
help their children choose the right classes in high school.</p>
<p>It was only natural for Ricardo to say yes. &quot;We also train them
to be leaders, to share their knowledge with their friend and
neighbors. We&apos;re starting from the roots and trying to grow a
tree.&quot;</p>
