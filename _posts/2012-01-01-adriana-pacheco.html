Adriana Pacheco, a senior at CSUMB, has won a William Randolph
Hearst/CSU Trustees&apos; Scholarship for 2006-2007.
<p>The award provides $3,000 scholarships to students based on
academic and personal achievement, financial need and community
service. The winners will be honored Sept. 19 at the CSU
Chancellor&apos;s Office in Long Beach.</p>
<p>Ms. Pacheco is a business major. She came from Mexico as a
child, and spent her youth working in the fields around the family
home in Gilroy, sorting and packing cherries, apricots and peaches.
After graduating from Gilroy High School, she enrolled at CSUMB.
Her ambition to become the first in her family to graduate from
college fuels her academic success.</p>
<p>In her service learning classes, she has worked in AIDS
prevention and as a tutor for the LUPE organization in Salinas.</p>
<p>More than 400,000 students attend the 23 campuses of the CSU
system. This year, 19 of those students were honored with Hearst
scholarships. The William Randolph Hearst Foundation established an
endowed scholarship fund in 1984 to honor the founder of the Hearst
newspaper chain.~ In 1999, the foundation partnered with the CSU
Board of Trustees to supplement the endowment with contributions
from CSU Trustees and private donors.</p>
