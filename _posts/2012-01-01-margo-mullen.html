<h5>A kelp forest grows in the swimming pool</h5>
<p>Between February and June of 2006, Visual and Public
Art major Margo Mullen transformed CSUMB&apos;s Aquatic Center. For her
Senior Capstone, she singlehandedly covered the 100 foot by 16 foot
wall of the center with a scientifically accurate mural depicting a
kelp forest. Although she did all of the painting herself, the
community played an important role in the process.<br>
<br>
Margo, originally from Sacramento, spent two years working at the
pool as a lifeguard and wanted the mural to be a gift to those who
frequent the Aquatic Center. &quot;I wanted it to be a community-based
mural, and one community here in Monterey is the kelp forest.
Everything in that forest depends on each other. Here at CSUMB,
this community, we also rely on each other. I wanted to portray
that, especially there at the Aquatic Center.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of Margo&apos;s prior painting experience took place
alone in the studio. At the Aquatic Center, Margo soon discovered
what it was like to create art in the midst of that community. &quot;At
first I was very nervous because I had never worked around people.
In this area there are a lot of divers, a lot of people who hang
out in the kelp forest, so it was a little intimidating to do this
work in front of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Margo went to great lengths to ensure that her painting was an
accurate depiction of existence in the Monterey Bay. Although she
is a lifelong swimmer, she&apos;s never been scuba diving. &quot;I had to
learn so much information about this kind of environment.&quot; Luckily,
Margo&apos;s roommate, an Earth Systems Science &amp; Policy major, was
always willing to discuss sea life. &quot;She had all these books about
fish and invertebrates that I would use to do sketches and
watercolors. You have to practice it so many times before you put
it on the wall.&quot;</p>
<p>When her roommate didn&apos;t have the answer, Margo turned to the
Monterey Bay Aquarium. The aquarium was also a source of
inspiration-several of the fish Margo spotted in the aquarium&apos;s
tanks found their way into the mural. &quot;The California sheephead was
so beautiful I just had to have him. They are all born female, and
at about seven years they turn into males. Only the males have the
red stripe and the black,&quot; explained Margo.</p>
<p>Sometimes it could be challenging to reconcile her vision with
the facts. &quot;The tube anemones live on the sandy part. I love these
because of the colors and wanted to have just a million of them all
over the place. But, realistically, they have to be a couple feet
apart in order to get their food-if they were all together they
wouldn&apos;t be able to survive.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a challenging project from the start-on the
first day when she was cleaning and prepping the wall, in the rain,
the pressure washer ran out of gas. Then she had difficulty moving
the scaffolding close enough to reach the top corners. Todd Kruper,
the VPA studio tech, helped Margo rig a new top to the scaffolding
that was safe and allowed her to get into the tight corners. In the
end, it came down to a time crunch. &quot;I really had to start working
all day from eight to six, take my lunch, and eat there. It was a
little hard, but I got through it.&quot;</p>
<p>Ultimately, Margo found that the Aquatic Center community was
incredibly supportive and appreciative of her work. &quot;It was a lot
of fun. There were so many stages to the wall, and they&apos;d come in
and talk about it. People would walk by and say, &apos;I like this. This
is cool!&apos; You start to think, &apos;Maybe I can make a difference over
here. This really is cool.&quot;</p>
<p>Margo knew she wanted to pursue art in college and came to CSUMB
because of the emphasis on community within the VPA program. &quot;I
fell in love with the VPA department-the staff and faculty.&quot; Margo
is minoring in Communications Design, another avenue for her
artistic skills. &quot;I&apos;d like to get a graphics or web job and do my
murals at night.&quot; Margo has one more year to complete her minor and
hopes to stay in the area after graduation. She&apos;d love to continue
to paint the CSUMB campus. &quot;Commission me and I will be there!</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ve learned that this is something that I love and I want to
pursue, so I&apos;m going try and keep going out here in Monterey,
splashing the walls to see what we can get.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above story was written while Margo
was a student. Following her graduation, Margo began a job as a
graphic designer with the Salinas design firm TMD Creative. She
continues to pursue a painting career and is actively involved in
the Monterey and Salinas art communities. Her paintings and digital
artwork have been displayed at the Monterey Blues Fest, Sand City&apos;s
West End Celebration, the CSUMB Alumni &amp; Visitors Center, the
Lauren Taylor Gallery of Fine Arts, the Monterey Museum of Arts
<em>Arts Lounge</em>, and a special event featuring young local
artists in Sand City called <em>Untapped Desires</em>. She is also
working on a mural commissioned for the city of Marina.</p>
<p>Margo says &quot;Since graduating I have increased my ties with the
Monterey County art community. I have found a strong group of young
artists in the area ready to make a change. We are all so eager to
create and live our lives as professional artists. I am so stoked
to be a part of this community and I am learning everyday as I
travel in this journey as a young female artist in Monterey
County.&quot;</p>
