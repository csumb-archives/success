<p>Can
the city of Surfers Paradise live up to its name?</p>
<p>Coastal and Watershed Science &amp; Policy graduate student
Jason Maas-Baldwin spent two very intense weeks in Australia&apos;s Gold
Coast helping develop an urban plan to ensure that it does. Jason
traveled to Surfers Paradise as part of a team of 20 international
interns from EDAW, a renowned design firm with 34 offices
worldwide.</p>
<p>The Surfers Paradise city council challenged the EDAW interns to
develop a 100 year plan for the coastal town facing rising sea
levels and a growing population. &quot;For two weeks, we worked 16-18
hour days,&quot; says Jason, who was the sole scientist on the team.
Most of the other interns had backgrounds in landscape architecture
or city planning.</p>
<p>&quot;Water played a major part of the 100 year plan, and my role was
to advise the architects and designers. I helped them develop the
kinds of design forms that would work with the environment and
identified areas not to develop, areas with critical natural
process not to be disturbed.</p>
<p>&quot;My background as a research scientist put me in a unique
position. I had never worked in a studio environment where ideas
were not bounded by the constraints of scientific uncertainty.&quot;</p>
<p>Over the course of the two weeks, Jason was challenged to
reconcile his views, based on scientific approaches, with the need
for a slick, marketable plan. Another intern, Chen Chen from
Shanghai Tongji University in Hong Kong explained that Jason&apos;s
ideas needed &quot;a sexier cover that sells the ecology by describing
the unique experience.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This principle may be common to those from the design
profession,&quot; says Jason, &quot;but it was new to me.&quot;<br>
Jason&apos;s emphasis on sustainability and respect for the unique
natural setting did become a central part of the end vision. The
group&apos;s final presentation, entitled &quot;Intertidal Urbanity&quot; imagines
the future Surfers Paradise as &quot;an international icon, where the
attraction lies not in its excess, but rather in its radical and
cutting edge integration with its spectacular natural
environment.&quot;</p>
<p>The group&apos;s presentation to the city council and the public was
well received and now it&apos;s up to the city to implement the plan.
Following the presentation, Jason returned to the U.S. and spent
the remainder of the internship working in EDAW&apos;s San Francisco
office where he had a hand in a number of other environmental
consulting projects.</p>
<p>Now,
having completed the internship, Jason is back on campus working on
his master&apos;s thesis, an evaluation of 20 urban stream restoration
projects in the Bay Area. &quot;Urban restoration evaluation is tricky,&quot;
says Jason. &quot;In a wild river project, the primary concerns are the
ecological and physical restoration. With urban river restoration,
the ecological concerns can take a backseat to the culture of the
area or the need for flood control. But when done properly, it is
possible that the restoration provides flood control, enhances the
ecology, and becomes a renewed cultural location within the
community.&quot;</p>
<p>Jason&apos;s evaluations will take all three factors into
consideration. When he completes the study, he will provide the
results to the California Department of Water Resources, the
primary funder of urban river restoration projects in our
state.</p>
<p>After
earning his master&apos;s degree, Jason plans on pursing a teaching
career. &quot;My dream is to take outdoor education to the high school
level, to work on applied projects with high school students that
get them into the field or on trips to other countries.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a realization at the end of my undergrad career that the
reason we have higher education is to provide a place for us to
deeply explore our own interests and foster new interests. At that
point I became a true lifelong learner, more interested in learning
than passing a test or getting a grade in a class. I realized how
much fun it is to think...I want to go into teaching for the love
of learning and give people the experience I had, make them
actually enjoy learning. Hopefully they&apos;ll come to understand that
at a younger age than I did.&quot;</p>
<p>Even if he came to that understanding late, Jason has made the
most of it in his time at CSUMB.<br></p>
