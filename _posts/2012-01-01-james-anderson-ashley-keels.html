<p>&quot;I
don&apos;t think I would have been able to get through without him,&quot;
Ashley Keels says about her husband, James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Anderson.</p>
<p>&quot;The only reason I graduated with my GPA was, not so much that I
had to compete with her, but I saw what she did and I was like, &apos;Oh
wow, I better do as well,&apos;&quot; says Jimmy. &quot;I can&apos;t have her showing
me up in front of the dog.&quot;</p>
<p>In May 2008, Ashley and Jimmy graduated from CSUMB summa cum
laude. Now, Ashley, Jimmy, the dog, the rabbit and the fish are
headed to the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where Ashley and
Jimmy will pursue graduate degrees -- Ashley a Ph.D. in cell and
molecular biology, Jimmy a law degree. Both received Advanced
Opportunity Fellowships, which cover full tuition. The dog will
continue to keep an eye on Jimmy&apos;s GPA.</p>
<h4>Early Obstacles</h4>
<p>From an early age, both Ashley and Jimmy had obstacles to
overcome.</p>
<p>Until the age of seven, Ashley lived in a rough neighborhood of
Richmond, California. Surrounded by drugs and gang violence, she
committed to a different path -- one of study and hard work. &quot;As a
black girl growing up in a dangerous environment, there were many
difficult and trying times for my family and me,&quot; Ashley says.
&quot;They drove me to stay focused on my goals. Despite all the
obstacles that have been placed in my way, and despite all the
expectations society may have of me as an African American female,
I overcame them and paved my way to college.&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmy grew up in Patterson, California, a small town in the
Central Valley. As a biracial person who identifies most closely
with his Mexican American/Chicano heritage, he had to confront many
stereotypes and expectations about who he was and how he should
act. His mother, a Mexican immigrant, learned English by watching
Sesame Street with Jimmy between her shifts at a vegetable packing
plant while his father, a white American, worked long hours as a
truck driver. Both of Jimmy&apos;s parents worked hard, but his family
always struggled financially. &quot;Their struggle has inspired me never
to quit in the face of adversity and I have taken this with me to
college,&quot; Jimmy says.</p>
<h4>Coldstone Connection</h4>
<p>In 1994, Ashley&apos;s family moved to Modesto, about 40 minutes from
Patterson. In high school, she worked at the Modesto Coldstone
Creamery, and one day she was called down to sub for a sick
employee at the Turlock location -- where Jimmy happened to work.
After work that day, he asked her on a date. They&apos;ve been together
ever since.</p>
<h4>College Bound</h4>
<p>&quot;When I met Jimmy I wasn&apos;t aiming to go college outside of the
local junior college,&quot; Ashley says. &quot;I basically came to CSUMB
because he did.&quot;</p>
<p>Jimmy decided on CSUMB after visiting several universities. &quot;It
came down to economics,&quot; he says. &quot;CSUMB was affordable and I loved
the location.&quot;</p>
<p>From the start, Ashley knew she wanted to major in Earth Systems
Science &amp; Policy. &quot;I found that I had a real passion for
research in the sciences,&quot; she says. &quot;This passion combined with
the confidence I have gained from faculty support has encouraged my
appetite for discovery.&quot;</p>
<p>As Ashley became more involved in the sciences, she took on a
research project to develop a way to identify cyanobacteria that,
when triggered, produce toxins that are harmful to wildlife and
humans.</p>
<p>With guidance from three faculty members, Ashley worked on the
molecular aspect of the project, creating a test to identify which
genes were responsible for producing toxins. &quot;The DNA and genetics
stuff, that&apos;s what I think is really interesting,&quot; she says. &quot;This
research has given me the opportunity to learn about genetics and
biology in a hands-on, real world setting as opposed to reading
about it in a textbook, which has given me a much deeper
understanding.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jimmy had set his sights on law school and designed
his own curriculum through the Integrated Studies major.
&quot;Integrated Studies gave me the flexibility to do what I wanted to
do,&quot; he says. &quot;I combined Global Studies with Human Communication
to get some international relations as well as history and prelaw
courses.&quot;</p>
<p>Outside of class, Jimmy took a job at a local law firm to
bolster his experience. &quot;Working on various legal projects has
shown me how difficult a lawyer&apos;s job is but also how rewarding it
can be,&quot; he says.</p>
<h4>The Next Step</h4>
<p>Up next, graduate school. Because of their strong
qualifications, the pair sweated through the application and
selection process, facing the unique problem of too many
choices.</p>
<p>&quot;We applied to so many schools,&quot; says Jimmy. &quot;Ashley applied to
21 schools; I applied to 22.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We were praying to both get into at least one. We didn&apos;t want
to go to separate schools,&quot; Ashley says. &quot;And then we got eight
matches&#x2026;and then life got hard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We definitely had competing interests,&quot; Jimmy says.</p>
<p>&quot;The best law schools do not necessarily have the best science
programs and the best science programs do not necessarily have the
best law schools,&quot; Ashley adds.</p>
<p>&quot;We kind of met in the middle with Wisconsin,&quot; says Jimmy. &quot;It&apos;s
a really amazing institution for both of us and we could both do
what we wanted. And we loved Madison.&quot;</p>
<h4>Family Impact</h4>
<p>Though the move to Madison will be a big change for the couple,
they, and their families, are proud and looking forward to their
future accomplishments.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m the first scientist in my family by far. We have a lot of
teachers, but nobody&apos;s pursued a higher degree, especially a Ph.D.,
especially in something like science,&quot; says Ashley.</p>
<p>She has been something of an inspiration. &quot;Since I&apos;ve been at
CSUMB, my mom has gotten her associate degree,&quot; she says. &quot;When I
talk to them about what I do, they don&apos;t always get it, but they
think it&apos;s really cool and are really excited.&quot;</p>
<p>Likewise, Jimmy&apos;s mother has started on her bachelor&apos;s degree in
Spanish at the local junior college. She has plans to transfer to
the local CSU.</p>
<p>&quot;Both my parents are excited about where I am going and love to
tell all their friends and boost me up,&quot; he says. &quot;They are really
happy and really proud.&quot;</p>
<h4>Long-term goals</h4>
<p>If all goes as planned, Jimmy will finish his program in three
years. Ashley&apos;s, however, will take six. Their ultimate goal is to
return to California, where Ashley hopes to complete her post
doctorate research at one of several prestigious institutions. &quot;We
have Scripps; we have Berkeley; we have UC San Francisco - really
great schools to do research,&quot; she says.</p>
<h4>Parting advice</h4>
<p>Looking back, Jimmy offers this advice to students: &quot;It&apos;s what
you make of a situation. Both Ashley and I worked really, really,
really hard and we ended up at one of the top universities in the
nation. Top universities do recruit from schools like CSUMB; they
do want students from these backgrounds. Try to find what&apos;s right
for you and work really hard and you can do it.&quot;<br></p>
