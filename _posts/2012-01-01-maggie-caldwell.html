<h5>Finding a path between writing and the environment</h5>
<p>&quot;I spent all summer after graduation looking at the newspaper
want ads and saying, &apos;Now that I am a college graduate, there are
hundreds of jobs I can get,&apos;&quot; says Maggie Caldwell &apos;06.</p>
<p>Maggie knows the difference between having a degree and not
having one-she decided to go back to school at age 40. Now, despite
all the jobs she&apos;s qualified for, Maggie has decided to follow a
different path by starting her own business, Aptos Multimedia.
Being self-employed enables her to remain very involved in the
lives of her two boys, Max, 14, and Sam, 8, as well as work on what
she loves.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to pursue employment as a writer and I&apos;m also
interested in the Monterey Bay environment and environmental
science,&quot; says Maggie. By majoring in Human Communication and
minoring in Earth Systems Science &amp; Policy, Maggie tailored her
education to these interests. &quot;[Professor] Rina Benmayor really
steered me in the right direction.&quot;</p>
<p>In her second semester at school, Maggie found a job on the ESSP
internship website that required her to combine her two areas of
study. Using her knowledge of environmental science and her writing
skills, she helped Watsonville Wetlands Watch develop a curriculum
guide for elementary school students.</p>
<p>Today, Wetlands Watch has become one of Maggie&apos;s clients. &quot;After
I graduated I was hired to help with their middle school curriculum
project. It&apos;s really cool to take the best of what I got at CSUMB
and translate it into something other students and teachers can
use.&quot;</p>
<p>Maggie has also written articles for the <em>Aptos Times</em>
and <em>Monterey Bay Parent</em>, and this spring <em>Ocean
Magazine</em> will feature several of her photographs (including
the photo of the gull on the left). &quot;This is the first time a big
glossy national publication has picked up my work.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to glossy, nationwide media exposure, Maggie has
received recognition for her Capstone project. The CSUMB Faculty
Senate selected Maggie as one of three students to represent CSUMB
at the Twenty-First Annual CSU Student Research Competition in
Dominguez Hills.</p>
<p>&quot;My Capstone advisors, Rina Benmayor and <a href="http://hcom.csumb.edu/site/x7263.xml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Qun Wang</a>, really kept me focused and moving in the
right direction,&quot; says Maggie.</p>
<p>Her Capstone, titled Habitat of Identities: Oral Histories of
the Watsonville Wetlands, analyzes the oral histories of seven
people who at one time or another lived on Harkins Slough Road.
Through the interviews Maggie explored the way living in the
wetlands shaped her subjects&apos; identities. From the start, when
Maggie selected her major and minor, through her studies where she
found the right internship and completed an exemplary Capstone, to
her new career as a freelance writer, Maggie has succeeded in
connecting her love of writing and interest in the environment to
the work she produces. This ability to bring seemly divergent paths
together should serve her well in the future as she continues to
find success as a college graduate.</p>
