<h5>An advocate for education </h5>
<p>Salinas Union High School Board trustee Kathryn Ramirez &apos;98
believes in the transformative power of education. She&apos;s
experienced it herself, and now she does everything she can to make
sure kids in Salinas, California, and the nation hear that
message.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe we need to change the way we talk to our kids. We
need to say &apos;when you go to college&apos; not &apos;if,&apos; and ask &apos;where are
you going to graduate from college&apos; not &apos;where are you going to go
to college,&quot; says Ramirez. &quot;I believe education is a right.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramirez grew up in Monterey County and attended North Salinas
High School. She was an average student, earning mostly C&apos;s.
Ramirez feels that because she was so average, she was overlooked.
&quot;Now, as a board member, I only see the very best and very worst
students. The worst when they are in trouble, getting expelled, and
the best when they win some sort of award. It&apos;s the average kids,
the ones in between we need to target. When you are in the middle,
you get ignored.&quot;</p>
<p>These are the kids Ramirez tries to reach with her story. &quot;I was
persistent. I didn&apos;t know what I wanted to be, but I didn&apos;t give
up.&quot; After high school, Ramirez attended Hartnell, where, even
though she had graduated from high school, she was told she had to
take remedial classes. &quot;The school district didn&apos;t prepare me. I
didn&apos;t have the support.&quot; It took Ramirez six years to graduate
from Harnell with an associate&apos;s degree in transfer studies.</p>
<p>Ramirez then enrolled at CSUMB, and suddenly, things changed.
&quot;Before CSUMB I was a flower with the bud closed. CSUMB was the
water I needed to bloom.&quot; At first, Ramirez though she&apos;d major in
business, but she soon realized that her pathway was education. &quot;I
wanted to be in education because education had saved me,&quot; says
Ramirez.</p>
<p>She earned her degree in Liberal Studies and is now enrolled in
the master&apos;s program in education. &quot;At CSUMB, they&apos;re not just
educating people to become teachers and administrators. It&apos;s up to
us to decide what area of education we want to be in. We can be in
the classroom or on the school board, setting policy.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramirez taught for a few years before joining the Salinas Union
High School Board in 2003. She is also an executive board member of
the California Latino School Board Association. In these roles,
Ramirez has become a fierce advocate for California&apos;s
schoolchildren, working to ensure that the school district
effectively prepares students for college. She also spreads her
philosophy that education is a right, communicating to students and
parents that college is a realistic, and necessary, pathway. She
even has a myspace page where she posts comprehensive scholarship
information.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ve worked on the district, city, and state levels,&quot; says
Ramirez. She recently went to Washington D.C. to lobby Congress.
&quot;The congressmen I met with were very sympathetic and hopeful that
we can accomplish what needs to be accomplished to be effective in
educating the youth of our nation.&quot;</p>
<p>There have been challenges, but Ramirez approaches her role on
the board in much the same way she approached her education.
&quot;Things take time, but I am persistent. I&apos;m not going to give up or
change my path. When something is important to me, I&apos;m not going to
let it go. Our kids will get what they need to succeed.&quot;</p>
