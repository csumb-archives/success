<p>Lady luck and a lot of hard work landed Jessica
Massey an extremely competitive internship under some of the
brightest lights on the Vegas Strip-Jessica will spend her summer
working at the MGM Mirage Corporation as part of their Hospitality
Internship Program.</p>
<p>Five thousand students nationwide applied for the MGM internship
program, and of those only 63 were selected. Jessica is one of
three interns who will be working closely with the executive
director of human resources to write, revise or otherwise update
6,000 job descriptions.</p>
<p>Jessica applied for this opportunity in December 2006 after
business professor Suzanne Kroeze forwarded an email to all seniors
in the business major encouraging them to submit applications. &quot;In
April, she received a phone call from MGM and completed an
interview. &quot;I felt confident in my responses, but was not certain
of the outcome, knowing how many other deserving applicants there
were.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon after, Jessica received an acceptance letter and welcome
packet from the leadership development department. Professor Kroeze
commented, &quot;Jessica approaches opportunities with a sense of
adventure and determination. I am pleased that she earned this
summer opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>Jessica credits her mother for inspiring her to succeed in the
business world. A first generation college student, Jessica learned
the value of education watching her mother slowly climbing the
corporate ladder without the benefit of a college degree.</p>
<p>&quot;My mother, Melinda, started working as a cashier at a car
dealership when I was four years old. Through the next eighteen
years, she transitioned to receptionist, cashier, accounts
payable/receivable, assistant office manager, and finally office
manager for the Sangera Automotive Group, which is the Mercedes,
Volvo and Suburu dealership in my hometown [Bakersfield]. It was an
extremely long process but now she is very successful and highly
respected in that industry. Because it took her so long to climb
the ladder, she always reminds me how much more quickly she could
have done it if she had started out with a degree and better job
experience.</p>
<p>&quot;Being the first one in my family to go to college was very
intimidating,&quot; says Jessica. &quot;My uncle, who was like a father to
me, was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig &apos;s disease) in 2002, my
senior year of high school. It was important for me to postpone my
education to support my family during this difficult time. He lost
his battle with this disease in 2003 and I struggled to regain the
motivation for school.&quot;</p>
<p>After her uncle&apos;s death, Jessica&apos;s family urged her to continue
her education. &quot;[They] encouraged me to choose a school with a good
community so that I could fully apply myself.&quot; This important
criterion led Jessica to transfer from Bakersfield Community
College to CSUMB in 2004.</p>
<p>Another source of support for Jessica is the ALS community. &quot;My
uncle&apos;s disease opened my eyes to a community of people in my own
hometown who had daily struggles with ALS and no news of a cure. In
Monterey, I felt I could lend my time and energy to help ALS
patients and their families whenever possible.</p>
<p>&quot;My first year at CSUMB I saw a banner advertising
the Walk to D&apos;feet ALS at El Estero Park. At the walk, I met ALS
patients and their support systems. Knowing personally how taxing
it can be on a family to care for somebody with such a debilitating
disease on a daily basis, I knew I had to do more.</p>
<p>&quot;The second year I became a team captain and my small but
determined team raised nearly $1000 which went directly to the new
satellite clinic at CHOMP and to the home-care service to Monterey
County residents.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently I am working with Tim France of the ALS Association
Greater Bay Area Chapter as a media chair and walk chair for the
October 6, 2007 walk. I look forward to being a part of this
organization for the rest of my life.&quot;</p>
<p>Jessica&apos;s other plans for the future include graduate school and
continuing her business career. &quot;My goal is to become a successful
businesswoman who can make a difference in the community and to
important causes.&quot;<br>
<br>
With the MGM internship topping an already impressive resume, we&apos;d
say her odds are pretty darn good.</p>
