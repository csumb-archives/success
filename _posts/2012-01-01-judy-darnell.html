<p>Assemblymember John Laird has named Judy Darnell as
Woman of the Year for the 27th Assembly District. As state advocacy
director of the United Way Covering California&apos;s Children program,
Judy has collaborated with 18 United Way organizations and other
partners throughout the state to inform decision makers in
Sacramento of the pressing need to provide health insurance for all
children in California.</p>
<p>Judy accepted the award at a ceremony on March 5, 2007 at the
California State Capitol. The success of Judy&apos;s advocacy work has
helped make the expansion of children&apos;s coverage a top priority of
health care reform proposals with both the governor and the state
Legislature this year.</p>
