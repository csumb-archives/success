<h5>Using art to help youth</h5>
<p>As a young child, Trish Sullivan was quick to see
that a splash of colors arranged in an artful way could delight the
eye. This intrigue with color and design led her to a consuming
interest in art. Now, after successfully balancing family
responsibilities, work, and completing college, she&apos;s embarked on a
career helping young people to develop skills as artists and to
understand the important contribution of art to culture.</p>
<p>Trish had several reasons for attending CSUMB. First, the
university offered the Visual and Public Art major-with a focus on
community involvement. CSUMB was also close to home, enabling her
to continue working while attending classes.</p>
<p>For her Capstone project Trish founded a nonprofit community
arts organization: Artistas Unidos-Artists United. She&apos;s now its
executive director, promoting and supporting arts for the
under-served population in Salinas and South County.</p>
<p>To prepare herself to manage AUAU, she will earn an M.A. in Arts
Administration this summer from Goucher College in Baltimore. This
is a limited residency program, meaning that several weeks of study
take place on campus over the summer, with the rest of the course
work done online.</p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s been an amazing three years, and I&apos;ve learned how to run
every aspect of AUAU, as well as become an advocate for the arts
locally and statewide,&quot; Trish says.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been fortunate to work with the Visual Arts Department
at Hartnell College and the Hartnell College Gallery to bring
inclusive community art exhibits and events such as &apos;Bailando con
la Muerte-Dancing with Death&apos;, a multicultural celebration for El
D&#xED;a de los Muertos-the Day of the Dead-to the public free of
charge. AUAU has worked with the Valley Art Gallery, Sasoontsi
Gallery, the PaperWing Theatre Company, Ariel Theatrical, along
with local museums and historic sites, to develop and present the
First Fridays Art Walk.&quot;</p>
<p>The art walk in Oldtown Salinas is a free, family-friendly
community event held on the first Friday of every month. There&apos;s
something for everyone to enjoy: live music, visual arts,
children&apos;s art activities, dance, and theatre performances.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ve been an artist as long as I can remember. I feel that I&apos;m
lucky to be from an era that encouraged creative play, problem
solving skills, and critical thinking in kids; these are rarely
taught or promoted in our society today-rather, television, video
games, and computer technology are endorsed for our young people,&quot;
Trish says.</p>
<p>&quot;These pastimes discourage interpersonal skills and hands-on
learning which is so important for retention. I was also fortunate
to have had several inspirational mentors during my youth, and have
made a personal vow to repay the debt I owe to my teachers through
community work with local teens.&quot;</p>
<p>Trish notes that the most fulfilling work she does is with local
teens on art projects and arts management.</p>
<p>&quot;These young people are so bright-they come up with great ideas
and are willing to think outside of the box when given the chance.
Our future is in good hands if all of us could just encourage our
youth to achieve more. Lofty expectations from adult role models
result in higher accomplishments for our youth.&quot;</p>
<p>Trish was recently honored as a &quot;Champion of the Arts&quot; for
Monterey County. The Arts Council of Monterey County recognized her
for the work she&apos;s been doing for eight years to promote arts and
culture, as well as building bridges between diverse cultures by
way of the arts in Salinas and the Salinas Valley.</p>
<p>Every year, Trish works with a group of teens to organize and
present ArtSong, a Salinas Union High School District student art
exhibit. She also volunteers to assist teens from East Salinas and
South County to create large sculptures for First Night
Monterey-the New Year&apos;s Eve celebration for families in
Monterey.</p>
<p>&quot;The Visual and Public Art program at CSUMB challenged me in
many ways-just like real life. I was attending CSUMB when the
tragedy of September 11 happened, and the dialogue between students
during this time was eye-opening for me,&quot; Trish says.</p>
<p>&quot;Since I had studied Islam and Muslim culture, as well as the
history of Islamic Spain, I was able to provide an alternative view
of the culture than the popular media presented. Many of the young
students had never known about Islam before 9-11, and were
interested to have a different perspective.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1996, Trish received the Boronda International Study
Scholarship and spent a year in Spain learning about Islam in the
region. She says, &quot;this experience prepared me to deal with the
tragedy of September 11, not be afraid, and not blame all Muslim
people for the actions of a few.&quot;</p>
<p>Trish has a 22-year-old daughter, Tara, who currently attends
the University of Arizona. Her partner, Dan Beck, is a local artist
and musician who, she says, is as passionate as she is about
community involvement and arts participation.</p>
