<h5>On the fast track</h5>
<h6></h6>
<p>Amanda Quintero has been on a career fast track since graduating
as a Global Studies major in 2000. She went on to earn a master&apos;s
in public policy and administration from CSU Long Beach. She also
found time to study Mexican culture and Spanish at the Center for
Bilingual &amp; Multicultural Studies in Cuernavaca, Mexico. And
she has plans to enroll in a doctoral program in 2007.</p>
<p>Amanda is the director for research and sponsored programs at
CSU Channel Islands.</p>
<p>&quot;I oversee the development and submission of grant proposals and
contracts on behalf of the university,&quot; she says. &quot;Our office is
also responsible for the oversight of all faculty, staff, and
student research that involves human subjects.&quot;</p>
<p>Her office submitted 34 grant proposals in its first year and a
half of operation at the new campus-generating $2.5 million in
revenue.</p>
<p>Amanda is also interim director for the CSUCI Office of Service
Learning and Civic Engagement. In this role, she works with
faculty, students, and community agencies to integrate real-world
experiences with classroom learning. She credits CSUMB and its
service learning leadership program for her success.</p>
<p>&quot;Service learning and civic involvement play an important role
at CSUCI in shaping an <em>engaged university</em> in the
communities of Ventura County,&quot; she says. As for handling two jobs:
&quot;It&apos;s difficult to manage two startup offices at the same time, but
it&apos;s not impossible. I have an amazing family, an extraordinary
mentor and supervisor, and an excellent staff. The combination of
all three truly allows me the opportunity to do both jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;I decided to continue my education in public policy and
administration because I would eventually like to work in the state
legislature as a policymaker in the executive branch,&quot; she says. &quot;I
was inspired to continue working in higher education because access
to higher education is a policy issue that&apos;s close to my heart. If
I can bridge the community with higher education through
grant-funded projects and service learning, then I truly feel that
I&apos;m giving back to others the opportunities that were afforded
me.&quot;</p>
<p>Before joining CSUCI, Amanda worked in the Office of the
Chancellor as coordinator of AmeriCorps programs for the entire CSU
system.</p>
<p>&quot;I was recruited by the CSU Chancellor&apos;s Office of Community
Service Learning as a result of being part of the Executive
Fellowship Program,&quot; she says. &quot;As an executive fellow with the
Capital Fellows Program, I was placed with the former Governor&apos;s
Office on Service and Volunteerism, now the California Service
Corps, which administers AmeriCorps programs in California. I was
able to apply my knowledge of AmeriCorps program administration to
the systemwide administration of AmeriCorps in the CSU.&quot;</p>
<p>Amanda&apos;s career advice: &quot;I would say that networking skills are
very important. Use your educational experience as an opportunity
to get out into the community as much as possible, either through
service learning or internships. It really does help build your
resume. Opportunities, like national service, international or
local leadership programs, and fellowships, are great ways to
transition into the workforce.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update on Amanda, April 2008:</strong> Amanda now serves
as the Interim Associate Vice President for Research and Sponsored
Programs at CSU Channel Islands. In March 2008, Leadership
California selected her to become a member of its 2008 California
Issues &amp; Trends Program, a prestigious, yearlong program for 60
women leaders from across the state of California.</p>
<p>Through the program, Amanda&#xA0;will study critical public and
private sector issues and enhance her knowledge on California from
state, national and global perspectives.&#xA0; Along with other
women leaders&#xA0; from across the state, she&apos;ll connect&#xA0;with
top decision-makers, thinkers and practitioners.</p>
<p>Leadership California began in 1992 with a dream to inspire,
inform, and advance women leaders who would influence Californias
future. It provides a critical pathway for successful women who
care about advancement, achievement, and significance. These women
are not only talking about change, but plan to be part of making it
happen.</p>
