<p>Success Stories ~ Juan Perez</p>

<p>Juan Perez was raised in a farming family.</p>
<p>Using conventional methods, his family grew raspberries and
flowers on five acres of leased land in the Central Valley. But,
since studying science and environmental policy at CSUMB, he and
his family have switched to sustainable farming practices.</p>
<p>Juan came to the university in 2001. Like a lot of students, he
didn&apos;t know what he wanted to study. He started in liberal studies,
switched to computer science, then business. None was a good
fit.</p>
<p>&quot;Then, I tried science. I really liked it,&quot; says Juan. &quot;And then
I interned at ALBA - Agriculture and Land-Based Training
Association - and that made me decide that science and
environmental policy was what I wanted to study.</p>
<p>&quot;Since then, I&apos;ve done another internship with ALBA. The first
was research oriented, the second was more working in the field -
how to irrigate, etc. More hands-on.</p>
<p>&quot;Then, I interned at Serendipity Farms in Carmel Valley, where I
learned about marketing. It&apos;s all connected,&quot; explains Juan.</p>
<p>Everything he learned in class and through his internships
convinced him that conventional farming was not the best
approach.</p>
<p>&quot;When I came to CSUMB and learned about fertilizers and
pesticides and other issues, that made me not want to grow
conventionally. I wanted to try my hand at organics, and I wanted
to do it as a family.&quot;</p>
<p>To that end, he convinced his father, Pablo, to enroll with him
in ALBA&apos;s Programa Educativa para Pequenos Agricultores (PEPA), a
program that trains small farmers in sustainable production methods
and marketing techniques.</p>
<p>&quot;ALBA&apos;s like a business incubator, but for farmers,&quot; says
Juan.</p>
<p>When they finished the program last year, they leased a one-acre
plot from ALBA and named their farm J &amp; P Organics. The Salinas
farm has grown to two acres, and Juan has plans to expand the
operation.</p>
<p>The family grows strawberries, lettuce, cucumbers, carrots,
radishes, sweet corn, cilantro, tomatoes and bell peppers.</p>
<p>Juan&apos;s parents &quot;like being their own boss,&quot; he says.
They do most of the actual farming while Juan concentrates on
marketing and direct sales in addition to his studies.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest challenge for me,&quot; Juan says, &quot;was having so much
produce and not being able to sell it. We know how to grow the
stuff, but who was going to buy it?&quot;</p>
<p>He sells some of his harvest to markets such as Elkhorn Farm and
Mercantile in Castroville, where his parents live. And, he&apos;s
started his own subscription box service, known as community
supported agriculture (CSA).</p>
<p>Every Friday, Juan delivers about 35 boxes of produce - mostly
what his family has grown, but a few things that he&apos;s traded with
other farmers to give his customers some variety.</p>
<p>His clients are located all over the area - the Monterey
Peninsula, Salinas, Watsonville. &quot;I get to meet them, and they&apos;re
happy about this produce coming to their door. I tell them, &apos;it&apos;s
grown in your back yard.&apos; &quot; And every week Juan tucks a newsletter
containing simple recipes as well as a brief farm update into each
box.</p>
<p>Last October, Juan had a chance to attend Terra Madre, a world
meeting of food communities hosted by Slow Food International in
Turin, Italy. He was part of the Community Alliance with Family
Farmers&apos; California Ethnic Minority Farmers delegation.</p>
<p>The conference enhanced his understanding of sustainable
agriculture and the greater food community.</p>
<p>&quot;It was my first time out of the country,&quot; Juan says. I met
people from all over - Africa, Cuba. People from 150 countries were
there, even the president of Italy. It was about making
connections, talking with farmers from all over the world.&quot;</p>
<p>He attended workshops on soil and water conservation and
marketing.</p>
<p>&quot;A guy from Cuba was demonstrating a simple, low-tech and
low-cost way to irrigate using a valve, a two-liter bottle and
gravity,&quot; said Juan. &quot;That&apos;s the kind of thing we can learn from
other people.&quot;</p>
<p>Terra Madre taught him to &quot;appreciate life and conserve the
land.&quot;</p>
<p>Juan is scheduled to graduate in May. For his capstone project,
he&apos;s growing lettuce in an aquaponics system to see how much
nitrogen is removed from the produce and to find out if aquaponics
reduces the potential for water pollution.</p>
<p>Juan credits much of his success at CSUMB to Bill Head, a
faculty member in the Division of Science and Environmental
Policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Bill&apos;s a great motivator. He really pushes you. I owe him a
lot.&quot;</p>
<p>What&apos;s next for the 23-year-old?</p>
<p>&quot;After I graduate, I want to continue to farm, get more acreage,
sell at farmers&apos; markets, expand the CSA.</p>
<p>&quot;My parents and I want to buy our own farm and raise animals and
have orchards - apples, peaches and pears. I can see that happening
in a few years,&quot; says Juan.</p>
<p>So can we, Juan.<br></p>
