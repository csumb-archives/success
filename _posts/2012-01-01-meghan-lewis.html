<h5>Student promotes benefits of studying abroad</h5>
In 2004, Meghan Lewis&apos;s experience as an exchange
student in Florence, Italy, exposed her to different cultures and
enabled her to make friends in other countries. And it may have
advanced her academic career.
<p>&quot;It changed my life-that&apos;s why I&apos;m planning to go back. It also
makes you view the United States very differently,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Lewis, a native of Grass Valley and lifelong resident of
California, majored in Human Communication with an emphasis in
pre-law. She was attracted to CSUMB because of its small classes,
its diversity, the Human Communication major, and its proximity to
the ocean.</p>
<p>Lewis&apos;s interest in international affairs led her to pursue a
semester abroad. &quot;There are tons of programs available. Anywhere
you want to go, you can go. But you&apos;ve got to find it yourself; no
one is going to knock on your door.&quot;</p>
<p>The California State University International Programs allow
students to study at campuses in 19 countries and pay the same
tuition they would pay in California. &quot;But it ended up being more
expensive for me because, while tuition is the same, rent and food
are more expensive due to the exchange rate,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The school she attended was housed in a villa-&quot;old, run-down,
and definitely not glamorous.&quot; It was a CSU campus, not an Italian
university. &quot;I studied European Union politics, Italian
literature-Dante and Machiavelli-and Italian politics.&quot; Her
professors were mostly English-speaking Italians.</p>
<p>&quot;CSUMB was very helpful and accommodating in working out the
transfer of the credits I earned in Italy. I got half my major
requirements out of the way,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Lewis prepared for her year in Florence by taking Italian
language classes and a course in the history of Western Europe at
Monterey Peninsula College during her sophomore year and a class in
comparative government at CSUMB.</p>
<p>And what was the biggest lesson she learned?</p>
<p>&quot;I learned how to be respectful of other cultures. We
traveled a lot, taking weekend trips to England, France, Germany,
Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland. And we saw lots of Italy. We
took the train, backpacked, stayed in hostels-we didn&apos;t have a lot
of money. I learned some Spanish, French, and German. And I learned
that if I made a little effort with their language, it really
pleased people.</p>
<p>&quot;I also learned that I should explore my
backyard-California.&quot;</p>
<p>Lewis cautioned that overseas study is &quot;not for everyone-you
have to be self-sufficient in order to get out of it what you
should.</p>
<p>&quot;But I loved it. I can&apos;t wait to get back to Italy.&quot;</p>
