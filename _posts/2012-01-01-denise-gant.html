<h5>From energy litigation to government surveillance, Denise Gant
explores the complex world of computer security</h5>
<p>For Denise Gant,
the road to CSUMB has been long and winding.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Maryland, Denise graduated from high school
and went straight into Morgan State University, a historically
black college in Baltimore. After two years, she dropped out. &quot;I
needed to work.&quot;</p>
<p>And work she did, primarily in administrative positions. She
married, had children, moved across the country, and eventually
became a grandmother. When she was laid off from her job in
publishing, she decided &quot;it was a good time to pursue a different
goal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the &apos;90s technology was booming and I decided to pursue
that. I went to Heald College and was in the first class to receive
the computer tech AA degree. Right before I finished at Heald, I
got a job at Moss Landing Power Plant.&quot;</p>
<p>It was around this time that the California energy crisis was
peaking. &quot;I was hired through a temp agency to copy key people&apos;s
data for the lawyers during all the power company litigation.&quot;
Denise was originally hired for a three month period, but then the
attacks of September 11, 2001 occurred. &quot;My co-worker was in the
Reserves. He was called out to duty and I held his place until he
came back.&quot;</p>
<p>During this time, Denise worked as computer technician. &quot;Help
desk, teaching people how to use applications, getting new hires
set up. I maintained inventory and fixed it when stuff when wrong.
It was fun for me, an independent way of working, and I liked
that.&quot;</p>
<p>When her coworker returned, Denise found that her position with
Moss Landing was up. &quot;I decided to come back to school and pursue a
higher degree.&quot;</p>
<p>A TMAC major focused on networking, Denise finds security issues
to be most interesting. &quot;I took a class in wireless security and it
was just so exciting. And then I took an advanced networking class
where we continued wireless security and just network
security.&quot;</p>
<p>With security breaches grabbing headlines, Denise and her class
determined they should share their knowledge. &quot;Considering the
crisis with identity theft, and all that sort of thing, we can do
something viable and give that to the community. We can write a
paper for your grandmother that says, &apos;You want to use your
computer, this is how you protect yourself.&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Robert van Spyk led the entire class in writing a
white paper entitled Personal Protection: Crisis. Each student was
assigned a threat or a solution to electronic security. Denise&apos;s
threat: government surveillance.</p>
<p>&quot;These are things you heard from people that they called
paranoid. And then I started digging into it and I was just amazed.
There has been surveillance of every single electronic signal that
goes out-I&apos;m talking your cell phone, your fax, your computer,
whatever has an electronic signal.</p>
<p>&quot;All across the globe people are upset. Very, very smart people
are very upset about this whole scenario. I don&apos;t care if you hear
anything I write or say on the phone, but it&apos;s the principle of the
matter.&quot;</p>
<p>And the solution to government surveillance? Encryption. &quot;I&apos;m
finding that people, especially people from Scandinavian countries
who are very tech savvy and have very high degrees in computer
science, have created resources to help. I know Canada was doing a
lot to develop encryption software so that they could communicate
confidentially. It&apos;s a beautiful, great thing-technology that
addresses these issues.&quot;</p>
<p>To further increase her understanding of computers, Denise is
also minoring in math. &quot;Math is the language of computers. They
don&apos;t speak alpha, they speak numeric, and I knew that it would
help me in my field to know the logic.&quot;</p>
<p>Denise hopes to continue her studies in computers at CSUMB. &quot;I
want to go to grad school, and I&apos;m thinking here because it&apos;s a
continuum. I am happy with the level of interaction. I&apos;ve been to
other schools and a lot of those teachers didn&apos;t want that level of
interaction. So I&apos;m happy to be here.&quot;</p>
