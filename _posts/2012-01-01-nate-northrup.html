<p>More than 70 soccer players from all over the country traveled
to Wilmington, N.C., last April to try out for a single spot on the
Hammerheads, the local professional team.</p>
<p>After two days of workouts, Nate Northup earned that spot.</p>
<p>Northup&apos;s career began at CSUMB, where he played on the varsity
for four years and still holds the record for most career points.
After graduating in 2004 with a degree in Teledramatic Arts and
Technology, the Northern California native trained with Tres Cantos
Pegaso in Spain and with Hammarby IF in Sweden, then played for the
Boulder City Rapid Reserve in Colorado.</p>
<p>His experience abroad proved helpful when he found himself in
Colorado.</p>
<p>&quot;In Sweden, I didn&apos;t know a soul which was pretty difficult. I
learned a lot about myself as far as comfort level and also
training with players that are better than you,&quot; he said. &quot;I came
back to the States with a new level of confidence, which I think
allowed me to play for the team in Colorado.&quot;</p>
<p>Northup&apos;s journey to Wilmington came after he read about the
team open tryouts on the United Soccer Leagues website and decided
to make the trip with friends. The Hammerheads play in the USL
Second Division.</p>
<p>&quot;I just tried to play as relaxed as possible and as comfortable
as possible and I guess coach saw that or saw something that he
liked and I feel really lucky,&quot; he says of the experience.</p>
<p>Northup lists his goal in the May 5 match against the Richmond
Kickers as a season highlight.</p>
<p>&quot;The goal was definitely 1 in 100. It was a left-footed shot and
I hit it just how I wanted to,&quot; he said. &quot;Right spot and right
time; it was a pretty goal.&quot;</p>
<p>And Northup has enjoyed living on the East Coast.</p>
<p>&quot;I have absolutely fallen in love with Wilmington. It has a
really good small town charm to it, kind of like Monterey. Hands
down, I&apos;d rather play here than anywhere else at this point.&quot;</p>
<p>Northup is thinking about the future. He&apos;d like to have the
opportunity to play another season for the Hammerheads and would
also like to pursue possibilities in USL Division I and Major
League Soccer.</p>
<p>&quot;My whole thing is that I want to improve. It&apos;s just
determination and focus,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m definitely always trying to
move forward.&quot;</p>
