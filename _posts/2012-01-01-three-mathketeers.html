<h5>Students honored in international math competition</h5>
<p>Think of it as &quot;NUMB3RS&quot; with an agricultural twist.</p>
<p>While the hit TV show uses complicated math to solve crimes, a
team of students at CSUMB used it to solve a problem involving
irrigation of fields, and won a top academic honor in the
process.</p>
<p>The team-Christina Schmunk (&apos;06 ESSP and MATH),
Pamela Johnson (&apos;07 MATH), and Jonathan Offi (&apos;07 MATH)-had 89
hours to tackle one of three questions in the Mathematical Contest
in Modeling, a complex problem-solving competition. The students
chose a problem with real-world applications for the local area-how
to design an irrigation system that would minimize labor and
maximize efficiency and uniformity of water distribution.</p>
<p>The problems are designed to give students a glimpse of what
applied mathematicians might do outside of academia. The problems
are taken from the fields of science, engineering, and
industry.</p>
<p>The team won a Meritorious Award, the second-highest honor,
which places them in the top 15 percent of the nearly 1,000 teams
that entered the competition. Those teams represented more than 500
colleges worldwide, including Harvard, Oxford, Duke, the U.S.
Military Academy, and a number of universities in China.</p>
<p>The teams downloaded the problem from the Internet at 8 p.m.
(Eastern time) on Feb. 2, 2006, and then had four days to work out
a solution.</p>
<p>They didn&apos;t get much sleep during the long weekend of work, and
ate a lot of fast food. &quot;I&apos;d bring them pizzas,&quot; said team adviser
and math professor Dr. Hongde Hu, &quot;but I advised them not to stay
up all night-they needed a clear mind to tackle the problem.&quot;</p>
<p>The students did some experiments and field activities during
the four days, using a wireless tablet computer to design the
model, then explained their thought process in a 14-page
paper-including diagrams and graphs-that was submitted to the
contest judges. With so many entries, it takes several months to
score the papers; this year&apos;s results were just released.</p>
<p>Said team member Jonathan Offi: &quot;The really nice thing about the
team was how well we worked together. We were never even close to
arguing with each other.&quot;</p>
<p>The university has done well in the contest in the past. CSUMB
has entered annually since 2003; it earned honorable mentions in
2003 and 2005. &quot;When we see student success, we want more. And it&apos;s
good for the faculty-students push us, like we push them. Now, we
want to go to the next level-the top 1 percent-and earn an
&apos;outstanding&apos; award,&quot; said Dr. Hu.</p>
<p>That sentiment was shared by Offi.</p>
<p>&quot;I have one more year at CSUMB, so that means I have one more
competition to achieve the outstanding award that I haven&apos;t yet
received,&quot; said Offi, who was a member of the 2003 team. &quot;I think
this is an extremely prestigious competition and I am happy to have
been a part of it more than once.&quot;</p>
<p>At least one member of the local ag community has expressed an
interest in the university&apos;s mathematical research: Golden Field
Greenhouses of Castroville consulted Dr. Hu for help in figuring
out its most efficient product mix. Dr. Hu says his students are
always looking for real-world problems, and would be open to
requests for help from other members of the local agricultural
community.</p>
<p>The contest is funded by a number of prestigious organizations
including the National Security Agency, the National Science
Foundation, and the Mathematical Association of America.</p>
<p>Here&apos;s the summary of the students&apos; solution:</p>
<p>A farmer is interested in minimizing the amount of time he needs
to spend maintaining his irrigation system. Our goal is to design
an irrigation system and schedule that will minimize labor and
maximize efficiency and uniformity of watering radius.</p>
<p>With a &quot;hand move&quot; lateral sprinkler system (20m pipe with 10cm
diameter), we will be watering an eighty-meter by thirty-meter lot
that we separated into 3 plots (p1, p2, p3). The sprinkler pipe has
three Rainbird 18 Series VAN type sprinklers that are evenly spaced
at ten-meters apart. The spray radius of each sprinkler is 5m (10m
diameter) creating minimal overlapping vertically.</p>
<p>Our model consists of fifteen laterals movements across the
field, 5 rotations per plot. We constructed a schedule of rotation
for the plots using p1 (30m x 30m), p2 (30m x 30m), and p3 (20m x
30m). To maximize efficiency and uniformity of p1, we created 5
lateral movements. Evenly spaced, we positioned the pipe centered
with 5m gaps on each side. Position 1 starts 5m from the top of the
plot and rotates down to the 15m mark and then to the 25m mark.
This evenly primes the field without flooding any one spot.
Position 4 comes back up to the 8m mark and then jumps down to 22m
mark.</p>
<p>The union of the spray radius of rows 4 and 5 creates an overlap
of about 65% with rows 1, 2, and 3 which we found optimal in our
research. The overlap of the spray radius will cover the few gaps
(no direct water) in p1, without flooding any one point. We will
use the same rotation for p2 and p3. P3 has a different dimension
(20mx30m), so the third sprinkler in plot 3 will be turned off to
avoid un-necessary watering.</p>
<p>By keeping within the parameters given, our model says that no
part of the field will receive more than 0.67cm of water per hour
and every part of the field will receive 2.01cm per 4 days. The
labor involved is 2 minutes to rotate the pipe every 3hours and 45
minutes. Our assumptions include the soil type, environmental
conditions, and the lack of pressure loss on our system.</p>
