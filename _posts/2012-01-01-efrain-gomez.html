<p>An
artist since his youth, Efrain Gomez (&apos;03 TAT) has always loved
drawing and especially cartooning. Oddly enough, his proposal to
create a weekly comic strip morphed into a regular column reviewing
movies for Ink Magazine, a weekly entertainment supplement
published by the Salinas Californian.</p>
<p>Efrain explains, &quot;I&apos;ve always loved Calvin &amp; Hobbes and
stuff like that, and doing a comic has been always been a goal.&quot;
During his spare time in college, Efrain created
Kindalikesorta.com, a website that showcased his cartoons and
animations. When he saw that Ink was getting started, he jumped on
the opportunity.</p>
<p>&quot;I contacted Ink to see if they&apos;d be interested in me doing a
comic strip, and they said sure, they&apos;d take a local submission and
pay me for it. I had two panels, but I never developed a full
idea.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon after, Efrain went on the job market. He wound up landing a
job as a web content specialist at Trend Micro, an internet
security company based in Cupertino, but while perusing the
classifieds he noticed another opportunity.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw an ad saying Ink needed a movie critic, so I got back to
them and said, how about a movie review instead of a comic? They
seemed interested, so I sent in an application with examples of
movie reviews.&quot;</p>
<p>Sure enough, he got the gig.</p>
<p>Efrain says the education he received as a Teledramatic Arts and
Technology major relates indirectly to his day job at Trend Micro,
but his understanding of film history and movie-making techniques
definitely informs his movie critiques.</p>
<p>He relates that the biggest challenge is keeping the reviews
short and simple. &quot;I&apos;ve got to get to the point of the story and
summarize the core themes and say why I liked it or not in just 380
words. I can&apos;t get too heady.&quot;</p>
<p>He also must have an opinion. &quot;Movie reviews have to be
extreme-you either love it or hate it, but it can&apos;t be mediocre,&quot;
says Efrain. &quot;Sometimes it&apos;s hard to feel extreme and I don&apos;t want
to lie. Fortunately, Ink is pretty open to being random and off
topic, so sometimes I just comment on something else and have fun
and then say it was an okay movie.&quot;</p>
<p>Though Efrain occasionally feels the call of Hollywood, he&apos;s
committed to maximizing the life he has in Salinas. He still draws
cartoons and portraits and posts his work online. He also does
videography and graphic design on the side and uses his internet
savvy to help friends design and maintain their websites.</p>
<p>&quot;My name means fruitful in Hebrew, so I thought about that and
decided that maybe I&apos;m supposed to be fruitful. Sometimes I regret
not doing the L.A. thing, but I&apos;m content with what I&apos;m doing here,
and that I have a job and my family. Plus, I get to write about
movies and share the experience. Hollywood or not, I&apos;ll bloom where
I&apos;m planted. Wherever I am, I&apos;m going to produce and be
fruitful.&quot;<br></p>
