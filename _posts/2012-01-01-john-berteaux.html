<p>Every month,
philosophy professor John Berteaux writes a column for the Monterey
County Herald detailing his latest musings on life. His topics
often focus on race and other issues of diversity-a subject he
teaches at CSUMB-but occasionally he writes about his <a href="index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">travel experiences</a>
or evaluates the relevance of social traditions like the <a href="index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Homecoming Dance</a>.
You get the sense that John rarely lets a moment pass without
pausing to question its meaning.</p>
<p>This sort of questioning has lead John down some interesting
paths. Following a successful high school basketball career, John
joined the Marines. After serving for four years, he was accepted
to San Diego State as part of the first Affirmative Action class.
He quickly fell in love with the classroom and became a serious
student of philosophy and classical languages. After earning his
bachelor&apos;s degree, John was accepted straight into a Ph.D. program
in philosophy at UC San Diego. After a year in the program,
however, John began to question the relevance of his field of
study.</p>
<p>&quot;Philosophy seemed to me to be very abstract and disconnected
from the real world. I couldn&apos;t make a connection between the types
of issues we were talking about in the classroom and what was
happening around me in the seventies with the civil rights
movement. So I quit and went into business,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Over the next twenty years, John worked for a number of
companies in marketing and sales roles, and eventually started his
own marketing business. By the nineties, this path hit a dead end.
His business was failing and John was facing bankruptcy, so he made
the decision to chart a new course at age 47-he returned to
graduate school at UC San Diego to earn his doctorate in
philosophy.</p>
<p>&quot;With the business
under, with no money, trying to get a kid through college, I came
home one day and said, &apos;I&apos;m going to go back to graduate school and
get a Ph.D.-not a Ph.D. in making money, but a Ph.D. in
philosophy.&apos;&quot; John considers this to be one of his greatest
accomplishments, along with convincing his spouse, Suzie, to
&quot;overcome all my inadequacies and stay around me for 36 years.&quot;</p>
<p>After earning his degree, John taught as a lecturer at both San
Diego State and UC San Diego for several years, but after getting a
full time tenure-track professorship at San Diego State, he
realized it wasn&apos;t the right place for him. When he learned of the
position at CSUMB, he was drawn to the university&apos;s Vision
Statement and the opportunity to teach about diversity and social
justice. John recalls, &quot;When I read the job announcement and showed
my dissertation advisor the job announcement, we both looked at it
and said, &apos;this is the perfect job for you.&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>The new opportunities John found at CSUMB meant new challenges
as well. The emphasis on integrating technology into the classroom
forced him to explore different ways of teaching. John was
initially somewhat resistant, but by working closely with Kalpesh
Patel and the Center for Academic Technologies, John began
utilizing tablet PCs in his courses. &quot;When it was first mentioned
to me, I thought, &apos;Eh, I don&apos;t think so.&apos; But I gave it a try, got
frustrated, and turned it off. But it was something I kept coming
back to again and again. After two years using tablets, they are
now a mainstay in my classroom. The first thing I do is go in and
hookup my tablet.&quot;</p>
<p>CSUMB&apos;s commitment to service learning presented another
opportunity for John to grow as a teacher. In an article he wrote
for the <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/site/x10352.xml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Campus Chronicles</a>, John details the
challenges of cutting short his lectures to allow more time for
students to participate in activities that promote critical
self-reflection.</p>
<p>In addition to reflection on service learning activities, John
works to make sure his students don&apos;t run into the same problem he
did as a graduate student in the seventies. He illustrates how
philosophy is connected to real world issues by having students
discuss the ethical dilemmas embedded in current events. For
example, he might bring in a newspaper article about Americans who
don&apos;t have health insurance to launch a discussion of the
distribution of health care in our society and around the world. By
applying the theories of philosophers like Alastair Macintyre or
Thomas Hobbes to current events, John&apos;s students test the strengths
and weaknesses of various philosophical models.</p>
<p>John has further reconciled the disconnect between philosophy
and reality in his role as a member of the Bioethics Board at
Natividad Medical Center in Salinas. The board examines the ethical
questions that arise when doctors have to make difficult decisions
about how to treat patients.</p>
<p>&quot;You come to the hospital, you&apos;re a Jehovah&apos;s Witness, let&apos;s
say, and you need a blood transfusion. What are the ethical issues
surrounding that? What can we do, what can&apos;t we do? It doesn&apos;t have
to be Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses, it could be that you&apos;re coming into the
hospital as a pregnant woman and making decisions about your life
or the life of the child. That&apos;s really where those issues in the
hospital arise.&quot; The Bioethics Board reviews how doctors make these
challenging choices and their discussion in turn shapes hospital
policy and future decision making processes.</p>
<p>John&apos;s incessant questioning has led him down many interesting
paths, and continues to do so. His curiosity has taken him to Cuba,
Panama, and Venezuela; the disputed territories of the Middle East
including the West Bank; and <a href="index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">various barbershops in the Monterey Bay</a> area in
search of answers. Here at CSUMB, we are thankful that his
meandering path has converged with ours, and are confident that
many more interesting questions lie ahead.</p>
