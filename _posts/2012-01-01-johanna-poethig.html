<h5>Cities&apos; rich cultures bloom in murals</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Johanna Poethig, a professor of painting and public art, was on
professional leave during the Fall 2005 semester, and it&apos;s clear
she put the time to good use.</p>
<p>She finished two large mural projects, one in Chicago and the
other in Vancouver, Washington.</p>
<p>Poethig is an internationally exhibited artist, who, according
to Jon Pounds of the Chicago Public Art Group, &quot;would make a short
list of the most significant muralists in the country.&quot;</p>
<p>She designed and led the painting of &quot;Loop Tattoo,&quot; a
6,500-square-foot community mural that covers the side of a
building on East Lake Street just off Michigan Avenue. She and a
dozen artists from the Chicago Public Art Group painted the mural,
which measures about 50 feet wide and 135 feet long, on 270
5-by-5-foot square mats, which were mounted to the wall.<br>
<br>
According to <em>The Chicago Tribune</em>, the mural (<a href="http://www.chicagoloopalliance.com/latestintheloop/mural.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">viewable online</a>) begins about
240 feet off the ground. Near the top, a pink sky framed by leaves
and flowers gives way to a central swirl of figures-dancers, jazz
musicians, and athletes-against a vivid green background. In the
lower third of the mural, the border of leaves and branches turns
into interlacing rings or loops.</p>
<p>The figures and foliage are meant to represent the rich cultural
life and greening of the Loop, Poethig, 49, told <em>The
Tribune</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m a site-specific artist. I look for artifacts or symbols of
the city,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Poethig&apos;s beliefs sync with the social mission of public art-to
claim public spaces and transform them-principles she teaches at
the Visual and Public Art Department at CSUMB.</p>
<p>&quot;Taking a big public work outside takes space from advertising,
and we&apos;re able to see messages and pictures that aren&apos;t trying to
sell us something,&quot; she said. &quot;Putting something in a public space
that&apos;s art is a way for us to reclaim our own space.&quot;</p>
<p>In Vancouver, she worked on a two-story mural that graces the
lobby of a new building on the campus of Washington State
University-a mural that pays homage to local geography, history,
and education called &quot;Flight of the Mind, Exploration of the
Heart.&quot;</p>
<p>According to her proposal for the project, she hoped to
&quot;represent the study of science and technology while referring to
mysterious patterns of life.&quot;</p>
<p>The Columbia River is depicted across the bottom of the mural;
on one shore, a large bear can be seen clutching a salmon.</p>
<p>A gifted painter, Poethig thrives on community-created art,
which allows her to draw from other people&apos;s experiences and
translate them visually, she said.</p>
<p>According to Poethig, community art battles the myth of artist
as isolated male genius. &quot;I believe in breaking that down and
including people of all cultures and backgrounds.&quot;</p>
