<p>When applying to college, Christin thought that CSUMB
would be a good fit for him. He knew that it was important to
embrace multiculturalism prior to entering the work force, and the
emphasis on collaborative work seemed like an effective way to
learn. After graduating from Westchester High School in Los
Angeles, Christin made the move to Seaside and began what has been
a mutually beneficial relationship with this university.</p>
<p>Initally, math and writing proved to be obstacles in college,
but no academic challenge was insurmountable with all the
educational assistance programs available at CSUMB. By enrolling in
the Mathematics Review Curriculum offered by the Math Department
and the Writing Workshop of First Year Seminar, as well as making
regular use of the Academic Skills Achievement Program, Christin
successfully developed the necessary skills in math and writing to
excel in his major, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and maintained
a GPA above 3.0 for his entire academic career.</p>
<p>Christin has also been an active member of the Black Students
United (BSU), serving as the vice president, historian, and
webmaster. One of his biggest accomplishments while in BSU was
working with faculty and staff members to bring the first Black
History Month Art exhibit to the CSUMB library. Professor Richard
Bains of the MPA department was one of the lenders for this
exhibit. &quot;I thought the exhibit was very well done for an initial
effort and was very pleased with the respect and care that was
given to my pieces,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Christin is also a member of the Social and
Behavioral Sciences Association. As a member of that club, he
worked to provide sashes, deemed &quot;honor stoles,&quot; to the graduating
class of 2007. Christin felt it was important to honor the
graduates because he will be the first among his siblings to
graduate from college and knew many people in the major represented
the first generation in their family to graduate. He also felt that
one should honor graduating from their major. Christin says &quot;Being
the first child to graduate is an accomplishment, and being a proud
older brother, I am a mentor to my younger brother and sister. I
motivate them by encouraging them to reach their full
potential.&quot;</p>
<p>Christin plans to attend graduate school, where he will study
marriage and family therapy. He has been accepted to John F.
Kennedy University in Campbell and Alliant International University
in Sacramento. His goals are to become a licensed marriage and
family therapist and to work with a wide range of people, including
those with behavioral problems and mental disorders. He is truly
dedicated to helping people and motivated to become a
therapist.<br></p>
