<h5>Star designer</h5>
<p>Images of stars popped up around the local area as
publicity posters for First Night&apos;s New Year&apos;s celebration were
distributed. The artwork was produced by a CSUMB graduate (and
current university employee) and was the result of a partnership
between the university and the event&apos;s organizers.</p>
<p>For three years, First Night has worked with CSUMB in a
competition to develop the art that goes on buttons, posters, and
the web to promote the annual New Year&apos;s festival.</p>
<p>Students in Professor Bobbi Long&apos;s publications workshop find
out what it&apos;s like to work on a real-world project and First Night
gets high-caliber art that helps define its theme.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of the mission statement of First Night is to involve the
community, so it was a perfect partnership,&quot; said Sue Ann Hillyer,
visual arts director for First Night.</p>
<p>The work of Francine Aguirre (who graduated with her B. S. in
Telecommunications, Multimedia and Applied Computing in May 2005)
was chosen to promote the 2006 festival. Aguirre, a resident of
Salinas, is now <a href="http://marketing.csumb.edu/site/x8076.xml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">employed as a graphic artist</a> at
the university.</p>
<p>Her winning design is dominated by a field of stars on a blue
background, symbolizing the 2006 theme of &quot;Night of a Thousand
Stars.&quot;</p>
<p>Each December 31 for more than a decade, the nonprofit First
Night has staged an afternoon and evening of visual and performing
arts throughout downtown Monterey to welcome in the new year.</p>
