Ernesto Rojas loves to run.
<p>The 21-year-old senior from Fresno is a member of the
university&apos;s cross country team. He recently won the men&apos;s open
division in the Valley Runner of the Year Series, 15 races that
included half-marathons, 5- and 10-kilometer events and a 2-mile
race.</p>
<p>His high school coach, and his passion for running, led him to
CSUMB.</p>
<p>Bruce Wade, a teacher and coach at Roosevelt High in Fresno,
coaxed him into trying out for the cross country team.</p>
<p>&quot;He started talking to me one day in his classroom and asked me
to come out for the team. He said, &apos;Just bring your shoes and
shorts and come on out.&apos; So I did,&quot; Ernesto told the Fresno
Bee.</p>
<p>Some time later, &quot;Coach Wade told me I could go to college
without paying. I didn&apos;t believe him. I told him, &apos;How is that even
possible?&apos; I come from a low-income family. I didn&apos;t believe it
until I started seeing the paperwork.</p>
<p>&quot;Coach Wade encouraged me to come to CSUMB. He talked to me
about the Vision Statement and how it fit me really well. I decided
that CSUMB would be the right school to start my college education.
I liked the area and the idea of going to a small school.&quot;</p>
<p>Ernesto especially appreciates the one-on-one time he gets with
faculty members.</p>
<p>&quot;CSUMB has turned out to be more than I expected. I enjoy the
close relationship I have with my professors. I also enjoy having
the chance to go out and do community service. CSUMB gives students
a chance to get hands-on experience and relate it to your field of
study.&quot;</p>
<p>And, with hundreds of miles of trails nearby, it&apos;s a great place
for a runner.</p>
<p>Ernesto&apos;s best finish of the season came at the
Westmont College Invitational in Santa Barbara, where he covered
the 8-kilometer course in 28 minutes, 35 seconds, placing 14th in
the field of 70 runners. The Otters finished second in the
eight-team competition.</p>
<p>He&apos;s majoring in human performance and wellness education and
will graduate in the fall of 2007. After earning a teaching
credential, he plans to return to Fresno to teach physical
education and - following in the footsteps of Wade and Coach Yi
Mao, his mentor at CSUMB - coach track and cross country.</p>
<p>&quot;As a student, Ernesto is inquisitive and interested in the
science of exercise, things that relate to what he wants to do,&quot;
said Dr. Kent Adams, one of his professors. &quot;I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be a
good teacher. He makes people feel comfortable and relaxed around
him; that creates a good learning environment.&quot;</p>
<p>In a way, he&apos;s already started his teaching career by keeping in
touch with runners at Roosevelt High. What does he advise the young
men at his former school?</p>
<p>&quot;I tell guys that if I made it, they can do the same thing. I
try to tell them that anything&apos;s possible if you put in the
work.&quot;</p>
<p>And the miles.</p>
