<h5>TAT alum combines her love of dance with filmmaking</h5>
<p>Teledramatic Arts and Technology alum Rachel
Perez-Bitan screened her latest documentary at the REDCAT Theater
in June 2006. The film, <em>Countdown: Reflections on a Life in
Dance</em>, tells the story of post-modern choreographer Rudy
Perez. In addition to the screening, the.doc was picked up by 153
PBS stations and shown at several film and dance festivals.</p>
<p>A dancer herself, Rachel studied ballet with Francisco Martinez
and modern dance with Bella Lewitsky. In New York, she studied with
the Alvin Ailey Company. Then, in Monterey she met Fran Spector
Atkins, which led to her working with the Monterey dance company,
SpectorDance, for a year. This inside perspective has allowed her
to specialize in dance-related films. &quot;Having a dance background
and knowing the technique helps me know how to shoot and edit
dance. When I&apos;ve watched other programs, they were always shot from
a wide-angle. You don&apos;t see the detail, and that&apos;s always bothered
me. So having the dance background helps me know which parts of a
performance to show from closer up.&quot;</p>
<p>The Rudy Perez project began in 2003, when Rachel was
hired by a production company to research LA choreographers for a
huge PBS.documentary on Latino art and culture. Rachel was already
familiar with Perez&apos;s work, having read about him in the press and
taken a class with him once before. &quot;I knew of his reputation as an
interesting character and that his work was important.&quot;</p>
<p>Rachel went on to produce and direct an eight-minute segment
about Perez as part of the documentary. In the process, she
realized that his story really required a longer film. For the
first time, Rachel teamed up with her father who also works as a
producer and filmmaker. &quot;It was fulfilling because we get along so
well, but at times challenging because we are close. In the end, it
was a very successful collaboration. I think we will definitely
work together in future, because the film was such a good
result.&quot;</p>
