<p><strong>The
Making of a Scientist</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps Gabe Rodriguez was born to be a scientist. At an early
age, he exhibited scientific tendencies. &quot;My mother tells me that
before I could form a sentence, I would sit in the back yard, pick
rocks up, drop them, observe their motion and declare, &apos;Gravity,&apos; &quot;
Gabe says.</p>
<p>Today, he looks forward to continuing his research as he pursues
a doctorate at UC Santa Barbara. The recipient of a very
prestigious and highly competitive fellowship from the National
Science Foundation, Gabe will join the Department of Ecology,
Evolution, and Marine Biology.</p>
<p>For him, however, the road from Baby Newton to graduate student
wasn&apos;t quite a straight line. Over the years he imagined himself as
an astronaut, mechanic, engineer, teacher, and just plain
confused.</p>
<p>By 1999, he was struggling to get through community college and
working 20 to 40 hours per week in Los Angeles machine shops to
cover the cost of his education. &quot;I had little focus and no clear
goals,&quot; Gabe says. His grades reflected his busy schedule and
distracted mind.</p>
<p>At that point, Gabe did some soul searching and rediscovered his
passion for science, specifically environmental science. &quot;I feel
that the most important things in all our lives, aside from our
families, are the planet we walk on, the air we breathe, and the
oceans that surround us,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Armed with a fresh sense of purpose, Gabe structured his life to
revolve around science. He volunteered at the Cabrillo Marine
Aquarium as a tour guide and began searching out a university
program in marine science. The interdisciplinary Earth Systems
Science &amp; Policy program at CSUMB matched his interests
perfectly. He transferred in 2005 and graduates this May.</p>
<p>While a student, Gabe took every opportunity he could to get
hands-on experience in the field -- which proved pivotal to his
career. He spent two academic quarters engaged in marine science
research at Shannon Point Marine Center in Anacortes, Wash.</p>
<p>&quot;The entire experience was very challenging and I loved every
minute,&quot; Gabe says, &quot;usually being the first to arrive at the lab
and often the last to leave. Until then, my decision to study the
marine environment was largely based on a non-academic affinity for
the coast in southern California. At Shannon Point, I realized what
research really was and it became a fervent passion.&quot;</p>
<p>Following that experience, he applied for and received a NOAA
Hollings scholarship that allowed him to participate in a research
internship studying invasive alga in the Monterey Bay National
Marine Sanctuary with NOAA scientist Dr. Steve Lonhart. He
presented the results of this project at the Hollings Scholar
Conference, and is also engaged to present it to the Western
Society of Naturalists in November.</p>
<p>Those key research experiences helped Gabe land the National
Science Foundation fellowship, which will provide $30,000 per year
for three years to support his continuing education.</p>
<p>&quot;For me, a bachelor&apos;s degree is only the beginning,&quot; he says. &quot;I
realize that graduate school will be a lot of work, but I am
confident that I am adequately prepared for the experience and
eagerly anticipate the challenge.&quot;<br></p>
