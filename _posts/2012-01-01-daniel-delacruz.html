<h5>Won prestigious Hearst award as student, now enrolled at the
Naval Postgraduate School</h5>
<p>Daniel Delacruz was the 2005 recipient of the the prestigious
William Randolph Hearst/CSU Trustees&apos; Award for Outstanding
Achievement. Delacruz was honored at a ceremony at the September
Board of Trustees meeting in Long Beach.</p>
<p>The award provides financial support to students who show
superior academic performance and community service in the face of
personal hardship and challenges. Each honoree receives $3,000. In
2005, 12 students from across the 23-campus CSU system were
honored.</p>
<p>At 12, Delacruz was orphaned and, without parents to guide him,
dropped out of school. At 22, he was diagnosed with the same
enzyme-deficiency disorder that claimed his mother&apos;s life. Refusing
to be discouraged, he enrolled in computer courses, used the
Internet to locate a New York geneticist who was working on a
treatment for his condition, and undertook an experimental and
ultimately successful therapy. His interest in computer technology
was reinforced by this experience. After graduating from CSUMB with
a B.S. in Telecommunications, Multimedia and Applied Computing,
Delacruz has set his sights on earning a graduate degree in
information technology. Delacruz is now one of a very select few
civilians to be accepted into the Naval Postgraduate School.</p>
<p>&quot;I was astounded when I got the call that I had won the award,&quot;
said Delacruz. &quot;You do what you do without thought of outside
recognition. So, I was stunned and humbled and filled with
gratitude. Receiving this award has exceeded all of my
expectations. Maybe it will help others dream big when they see
what I&apos;ve done.&quot;</p>
<p>The William Randolph Hearst Foundation established an endowed
scholarship fund in 1984 to honor the founder of the Hearst
newspaper chain. In 1999, the foundation partnered with the CSU
Board of Trustees to create the Hearst/Trustees&apos; Award for
Outstanding Achievement. Contributions from CSU Trustees and
private donors supplement the endowment.</p>
