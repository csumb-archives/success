<h4>TAT alum helps Brooklyn Navy Yard rediscover its past</h4>
<h5>Lessons of Fort Ord inform Daniella Romano&apos;s work</h5>
<p>Daniella
Romano had no clue what she was getting into when she was hired as
the archivist at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.</p>
<p>&quot;The BNY Development Corporation hired me to arrange and do a
simple inventory of their architectural plans and engineering
drawings in January 2004,&quot; she says. &quot;I took the job because I was
intrigued by the Yard,&quot; which is now a thriving industrial park
with over 250 tenants from a variety of industries.</p>
<p>&quot;It felt like something to get my hands into so I could help
make a difference. Reuse of a military installation to serve the
community made sense to me, particularly following my experience at
CSUMB and the former Fort Ord.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to be involved,&quot; says Romano (&apos;97 TAT).</p>
<p>That &quot;involvement&quot; gave her a chance to continue her education
by learning about construction, development and municipal
government, and the initiatives to affect change in New York
City.</p>
<p>&quot;What surprised me was the history of the Brooklyn Navy Yard,
and its significance on the global scale.</p>
<p>&quot;This was the largest and most expensive naval shipyard in the
country at the time of its decommissioning in 1966, and study of it
is essentially a study of New York City&apos;s contribution to U.S. war
efforts. Its development over time serves as a reflection of U.S.
society at large,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>Romano always knew she wanted to do something that would make a
difference.</p>
<p>After graduation from CSUMB in 1997, she moved to Los Angeles,
where she worked for a small production company turning out
made-for-TV movies. A job with a news talent agency took her to New
York City in 2001, where she also enrolled in a master&apos;s program in
Library and Information Science at the Pratt Institute. She earned
her degree in 2004.</p>
<p>&quot;I made the decision to study library science after 9/11,&quot; she
says. &quot;That day, I had watched our correspondents and anchors keep
their cool and report on the disaster. I wasn&apos;t sure what to do,
but I wanted to enjoy a career where I could help.</p>
<p>&quot;My initial intentions to get into entertainment were
altruistic; I had a vision that conscientious mass media would
guide an empathic society. After some considerable soul-searching,
I endeavored to work with information, making it accessible and
transparent.&quot;</p>
<p>Making accessible the 32,000 engineering and architectural
drawings in the Navy Yard&apos;s collection has been a challenge.</p>
<p>According to a story in the New York Times, many of the
documents were growing mold when Romano first took the job. To
examine them, she had to don a hazmat suit.</p>
<p>Fortunately, &quot;I like projects that are a little raw,&quot; she
says.</p>
<p>Her original job of arranging the plans and drawings for
informational purposes quickly expanded when the financial value of
the information relating to buildings, subsurface and utilities
became apparent, and access fueled senior management support for an
archive and other programs. And her title changed along with her
expanded duties: she went from archivist to director of the archive
and project director for the Brooklyn Navy Yard Historical
Center.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like I&apos;ve had a chance to shape how the Navy Yard treats
its history,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>The archive collection is now used in the normal course of
business by all departments involved in development and
construction.</p>
<p>Not all the documents are technical. The oldest, she says, date
to 1856; they&apos;re drawings of a monument erected to sailors and
marines who died in Canton, China, during the Opium Wars. The
monument still stands in a hospital annex of the yard.</p>
<p>Romano says her experience at CSUMB gave her the wherewithal to
do start-up work, to develop projects that will contribute to
society.</p>
<p>&quot;Those were rough-and-ready days,&quot; she says of being a pioneer
student at CSUMB. &quot;It was a long way from the established
institution it is today, but that fact provided its own
opportunity. The students were able to shape the program to meet
their own needs.&quot;</p>
<p>One memory in particular sticks with her.</p>
<p><br>
&quot;Gene Evans, the cinematographer for the 1977 &apos;Roots&apos; miniseries,
taught me how to load film. I was so worried about exposing the
reels and certain I would devastate our small production. Gene
assured me all would be well if I just practiced.</p>
<p>&quot;He had me load what felt like hundreds of reels, and proved to
me that I was training my own instincts. If my body was practiced
in loading the film, I could trust it to not forget the myriad
details that my brain would let slip.</p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s a lesson I have taken with me through the rest of my life:
initial attention to detail and practice are confidence-building
tools.&quot;</p>
<p>And, she concludes, &quot;It&apos;s an honor to be a part of the reuse of
military intallations to serve the public, both at the former Fort
Ord and the Brooklyn Navy Yard today.&quot;<br></p>
