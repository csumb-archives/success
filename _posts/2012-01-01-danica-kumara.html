<p>Danica Kumara has spent the last six months in Kosovo
running a preschool. As a volunteer with the nongovernmental
organization Balkan Sunflowers, she lives with a host family in the
village of Plemetina and works on &quot;social reconstruction,&quot; or the
healing of the social wounds caused by the war. Most of the people
in Kosovo are Albanian, and have very little contact with the two
minorities that make up the population of Plemetina. &quot;We focus
mostly on minority educational projects,&quot; says Danica. &quot;The Serbs
and Roma, being the minority, are 65 percent unemployed and
isolated from the rest of the area.&quot;</p>
<p>Danica works with Balkan Sunflowers to operate the preschool
that 70 children attend daily as well as running a homework center
and other youth activities. &quot;Our main goal in the village is to
assist and encourage the Roma kids to continue their education.
They have a lot of difficulty because the schools are not taught in
their native tongue, Romanis, and education is not an important
part of their culture. Our programs give them a chance to work at
an equal level as their Serbian counterparts,&quot; she explains.</p>
<p>Danica, a Global Studies major, became interested in the
situation in Kosovo while working on her Capstone, a comparative
analysis of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia and the South African Truth Commission. &quot;I came up with
a hybrid strategy to deal with war atrocities and genocide. Doing
my capstone educated me on the area I now work in Kosovo, and the
effects of war on the people I am now working with. It allowed me
to understand the ways to deal with war trauma and some of the
effects these traumas can have on a community.&quot;</p>
<p>Though she had a strong background on the political aspects of
the situation, Danica got a crash course on the day-to-day aspects
of life in Kosovo when she arrived. &quot;I didn&apos;t know a single word
[of any of the three primary languages] before I went, but in an
emergency situation I learned quickly. Living with the family in
the community really helped my language skills. I speak a little
Romanis and understand a lot and I also now speak Serbian-since
Serbian is the language of instruction it is important I speak to
the kids in Serbian, but I speak to many of the youth in
Romanis.&quot;</p>
<p>Although only three kilometers away from the region&apos;s primary
power plant, the village has intermittent water and electricity
service. Many houses have electric stoves and washing machines, but
the people have adapted to life without modern conveniences-they
cook their food over wood-burning stoves, wash their clothes by
hand, and rely on outhouses rather than indoor plumbing. &quot;The
village is quite dirty. In addition to the pollution from the power
plant, which turns the white snow brown within hours, garbage is a
large problem,&quot; says Danica. &quot;Many people just throw their garbage
on the ground as they walk down the streets, or off into a ditch or
gutter, and at the end of the day, you can always smell the burning
garbage from around the village.&quot;</p>
<p>Plemetina was the site of a refugee camp created in 1999 by the
United Nations Human Rights Commission to provide accommodations to
displaced people belonging to Kosovo&apos;s minorities. At its peak, the
camp was home to 1,300 people, and many families lived there for
years. In 2005, families began to leave the camp and find new homes
in social housing projects throughout Kosovo, but many difficulties
remain.</p>
<p>&quot;It is really an amazing phenomenon, the entire situation in
Kosovo. Basically the people in the village have almost no
opportunities, no freedom of movement, education, access to
activities of any sorts, or employment. The entire situation is
difficult, the poverty and ethnic tensions making it worse.&quot; Even
eight years after the war ended, most Serbs and Roma feel unsafe
outside their enclaves. Though technically Kosovo remains a
province of Serbia, the area is still under the jurisdiction of the
United Nations.</p>
<p>&quot;We work there in order to improve their opportunities and allow
the children to be children and have a chance to improve their
future and the future of their village and the whole of Kosovo.
Minority education and integration are an extremely important part
of that,&quot; Danica explains.</p>
<p>Danica came back to California (she is originally from Marin)
for a few weeks in January before returning to Plemetina to
continue her volunteer work. Over the next few months she hopes to
launch a larger educational program and a multiethnic sports
program. Danica played volleyball as a CSUMB student, which she
says helped her stay focused. Now she hopes she can share her love
of the sport with the kids there. &quot;Hopefully we would have a mixed
Serbian and Roma volleyball club. I see this program as a good way
to begin interethnic dialogue between the minority youth.&quot;</p>
<p>Danica isn&apos;t sure how long she will stay in Kosovo doing this
work-much of it depends on funding and the direction the program
takes in the future. &quot;Eventually I would like to go to graduate
school, but for now I am getting a lot of experience and helping a
lot of people. Yes, it is a challenge and difficult at times, but
it is so amazing when the children call my name as I walk through
town-their voices and smiles make it all worth it.&quot;</p>
