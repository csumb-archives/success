Self-confidence &#x2013; acquired at CSUMB &#x2013; and support
from her professors has propelled DeeDee Adams into a role in this
season&apos;s hit TV show, &quot;Friday Night Lights.&quot;
<p>While alumni from the university&apos;s Teledramatic Arts and
Technology program work in the entertainment industry as producers,
directors, editors and in other behind-the-scenes jobs, no one has
had an on-going role in such a high-profile production.</p>
<p>Like the book and the movie, the TV series deals with the
success and failures of an embattled Texas high school football
coach and his team. But it also delves into issues rarely touched
on by network TV &#x2013; racism, religion, education and parent-child
relationships.</p>
<p>The show is shot on location in a small town north of Austin,
which is how Adams got involved.</p>
<p>&quot;I moved to Austin on Sept. 1, so that my husband could pursue
his music career,&quot; she said. &quot;I wanted to get into acting, but I
didn&apos;t want to move to L.A. I&apos;m a country girl at heart, and I just
couldn&apos;t imagine myself living an L.A. lifestyle. I hate the
traffic, I hate the cutthroat attitude, and I hate that I can&apos;t
afford rent down there.</p>
<p>&quot;Austin in affordable, and it&apos;s a hip city. Plus, there&apos;s never
any smog. There are a ton of opportunities here for anyone looking
to work in the entertainment industry. That&apos;s why Matthew
McConaughey, Wes Anderson, Owen Wilson, Renee Zellweger, Sandra
Bullock and Quentin Tarantino have made Austin their home.&quot;</p>
<p>Without an agent, she realized she&apos;d have to take matters into
her own hands if she wanted to find work.</p>
<p>&quot;I had lived in Austin a week when I sent an e-mail to a casting
director inquiring about work on &#x2018;Friday Night Lights.&apos; I found out
about the production by Googling around to see what was filming in
Austin. I put together a resume, wrote a charming cover letter and
sent a snapshot.</p>
<p>&quot;The casting director looked over my resume, liked my look, and
offered me a background role. That never would have happened in
L.A. I think he liked me because I wasn&apos;t afraid to get things done
myself. &quot;</p>
<p>And for that, she credits CSUMB.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old native of Indiana was an Integrated Studies
major, combining TAT and Human Communication. &quot;I wanted to write
and act, and to be prepared to do both,&quot; she said. One science
class away from graduation, she hopes to return in the spring to
finish her degree.</p>
<p>&quot;CSUMB equipped me with a &#x2018;can-do&apos; attitude. That fact that I
even got the job without an agent say a lot. I owe much of that to
Steven Levinson and Shannon Edwards (TAT), Lisa Crawford Watson
(HCOM) and Barbara Mossberg (Integrated Studies) for believing in
me and pushing me to excel.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&apos;t think I would have gotten that kind of support from
professors at any other school. I love that at CSUMB the professors
get to know their students and help them realize their
potential.&quot;</p>
<p>And the technical skills she acquired at the university have
proven useful.</p>
<p>&quot;My acting classes and my TV production classes helped
tremendously. I know my way around the set, which makes the crew
like me a lot. I explain what&apos;s going on to a lot of the other
actors who don&apos;t know as much about production.&quot;</p>
<p>She interjected a note of advice to aspiring actors: &quot;It&apos;s
always a good idea to befriend camera operators and production
assistants because they&apos;re the ones who can give you camera
time.&quot;</p>
<p>She&apos;s a &quot;featured extra&quot; on the show, which means she gets
camera time, but no lines. At least not yet. And that&apos;s fine with
the woman who ends her e-mails with a quotation from Milan Kundara:
&quot;There are no small parts, only small actors.&quot;</p>
<p>In episode five, set to air Oct. 31, a football player (one of
the male characters) flirts with her. Look for her in a scene shot
outside a diner. In episode six, she has several scenes, and even
more airtime in episode seven.</p>
<p>She seems amused that at 26, she&apos;s playing a teenager.
And she and the other younger members of the cast &#x2013; all relative
newcomers &#x2013; really look like high school students, not refugees
from an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch catalog.</p>
<p>Acting is hard work, she cautions.</p>
<p>&quot;TV work is not nearly as glamorous as it seems,&quot; she said.
&quot;There are days when you&apos;ll be called to set, and you&apos;ll have to
sit around in a hot tent and wait hours and hours until you&apos;re
used. There are also days when you&apos;ll work all day and realize that
you didn&apos;t get any camera time. For me, that&apos;s the most frustrating
part.</p>
<p>&quot;Some days it can be hard. At game scenes, I&apos;ve had to endure
blistering heat and bugs the size of small aircraft!</p>
<p>&quot;But is it fun? For sure. I&apos;ve been able to meet some
interesting people, in the cast and on the crew. Also, I&apos;m learning
so much about the entertainment industry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are days when I look at my bank balance, and realize that
I could be doing something else, making way more money. However,
when I&apos;m on set, I feel like I&apos;m home. I feel like I&apos;m doing what I
was meant to be doing: acting. I really feel that this opportunity
is going to be my first step in a long, productive acting
career.&quot;</p>
