<h5>The right stuff</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Doug Harris vividly remembers his hectic schedule the year he
graduated with his Master of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies. At
the same time, Harris held down a fulltime job for the city of
Richmond-and served as the executive director of Athletics United
for Peace (AUP), a nonprofit organization in Oakland dedicated to
helping youth overcome challenges through athletics. He found
himself commuting from Oakland to CSUMB on an almost daily
basis.</p>
<p>Somehow, he made it all happen.</p>
<p>&quot;After volunteering to set up exhibition basketball teams for
the AUP on a part-time basis, its departing executive director
asked me to take his post,&quot; Doug recalls. &quot;At the time, I was a
fulltime recreation and parks professional for the city of
Richmond.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1993, Doug accepted the executive director position, which he
continues in today.<br>
&quot;At AUP our focus is on the young people who live in Oakland, San
Francisco, and Richmond. These kids are living in a war zone.&quot;</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Doug has succeeded in furthering his
principal passions: helping young people succeed in their lives
through athletics and producing documentary videos of value to the
community. The same year that Doug enrolled at CSUMB he established
the AUP Digital Technology Academy, a 10-week media arts program
that introduces teens to the ever-growing field of digital video
and multimedia integration. Through this work, Doug produced a
series of award-winning documentaries titled <em>An Exploration of
Our History</em>. The documentaries chronicled and preserved the
history of communities in Contra Costa County.</p>
<p>His latest documentary, <a href="http://www.athletesunitedforpeace.org/am-bounce.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bounce: The Don Barksdale Story</a>, grew
out of his CSUMB Capstone project and airs on Fox Sports Network
Bay Area in February 2007. The film recounts the life and work of
Don Barkdale, the first black NBA All-Star. In a recent <em>LA
Times</em> article about the film, Harris explained that Barksdale
was &quot;kind of like the Jackie Robinson of basketball.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had met Don prior to the 1983 NBA draft,&quot; says Doug, a former
Berkeley High School basketball star and NAIA All American at
Central Washington. &quot;He was a scout for the Golden State Warriors
and he made a recommendation for the team to draft me. What I
didn&apos;t know at the time was that he was a true pioneer in
basketball.&quot; After being the Warriors&apos; No. 8 draft pick in 1983,
Doug played overseas for several years.</p>
<p>&quot;When it came time to do my Capstone, the film about Don came to
mind, especially since he&apos;d been in the Army at Fort Ord.&quot; Doug
hoped to raise the public&apos;s awareness of the legendary player with
the project.</p>
<p>As chronicled in Harris&apos; documentary, Barksdale was college
basketball first African American consensus All-American as a
senior at UCLA in 1947. He was the first black basketball player on
the U.S. Olympic team, winning a gold medal in London in 1948. He
broke the color line in the AAU&apos;s national industrial league, which
welcomed him when the NBA would not. And he was the first African
American to play in the NBA All-Star game, suiting up for the East
in 1953.</p>
<p>Harris&apos; efforts have helped land Barksdale in halls of fame
honoring California community college athletes, African American
athletes, Bay Area athletes and Pacific 10 Conference athletes. &quot;I
would like young people to know about Don, know about his legacy,
the way they know about Jackie Robinson,&quot; Harris told
the<em>Times</em>.</p>
